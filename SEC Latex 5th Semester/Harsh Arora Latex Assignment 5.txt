	\begin{verse}
		The moon ascends, a silver glow,\\
		Its quiet light, a calming show.\\
		Stars like whispers in the sky,\\
		Softly twinkling, caught on high.
		
		The earth is still, the winds at rest,\\
		Nightâ€™s cool embrace, its gentle test.\\
		Shadows dance on the silent ground,\\
		Peaceful moments softly found.
		
		In this stillness, hearts may heal,\\
		As nature's charm begins to reveal.\\
		For under the moon's eternal gleam,\\
		Lies the magic of a timeless dream.
