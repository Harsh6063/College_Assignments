       "'1Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone\\nCHAPTER ONE\\nTHE BOY WHO LIVEDMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\\nthat they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last\\npeople you\\'d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,because they just didn\\'t hold with such nonsense.\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\\nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as shespent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on theneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in theiropinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\\'tthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.Potter was Mrs. Dursley\\'s sister, but they hadn\\'t met for several years;in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\\'t have a sister, because hersister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it waspossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boywas another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\\'t wantDudley mixing with a child like that.\\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over thecountry. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie forwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screamingDudley into his high chair.\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,2because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the\\nwalls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He gotinto his car and backed out of number four\\'s drive.\\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\nsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley\\ndidn\\'t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of PrivetDrive, but there wasn\\'t a map in sight. What could he have been thinkingof? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked andstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around thecorner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was nowreading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats\\ncouldn\\'t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and\\nput the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought ofnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\'t help\\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\\'t bear people who dressed infunny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed thiswas some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steeringwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quiteclose by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley wasenraged to see that a couple of them weren\\'t young at all; why, that man\\nhad to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\\nnerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably somesilly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\\nninth floor. If he hadn\\'t, he might have found it harder to concentrateon drills that morning. He didn\\'t see the owls swoop ing past in broaddaylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazedopen- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had neverseen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectlynormal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made\\nseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a\\nvery good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\\'d stretch his legsand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.3He\\'d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\\nthem next to the baker\\'s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\\'tknow why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whisperingexcitedly, too, and he couldn\\'t see a single collecting tin. It was onhis way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that hecaught a few words of what they were saying.\\n\"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"\\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought betterof it.\\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\\nsecretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almostfinished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put thereceiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he wasbeing stupid. Potter wasn\\'t such an unusual name. He was sure there werelots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think\\nof it, he wasn\\'t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\\'d never even\\nseen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no pointin worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of hersister. He didn\\'t blame her -- if he\\'d had a sister like that... but allthe same, those people in cloaks...\\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and\\nwhen he left the building at five o\\'clock, he was still so worried that\\nhe walked straight into someone just outside the door.\\n\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\\nwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing aviolet cloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the\\nground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in\\na squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\\'t be sorry, my dear sir,for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone atlast! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,happy day!\"\\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\\nstranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever thatwas. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping4he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he\\ndidn\\'t approve of imagination.\\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --\\nand it didn\\'t improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he\\'d spotted thatmorning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the\\nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\\n\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn\\'t move. It just gave him a\\nstern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Tryingto pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was stilldetermined not to mention anything to his wife.\\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\\nabout Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley hadlearned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. WhenDudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time tocatch the last report on the evening news:\\n\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\'s\\nowls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normallyhunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have beenhundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction sincesunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenlychanged their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin.\"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going\\nto be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"\\n\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\\'t know about that, but it\\'s not\\nonly the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart asKent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that insteadof the rain I promised yesterday, they\\'ve had a downpour of shooting\\nstars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it\\'s\\nnot until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\\nOwls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...\\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\\nno good. He\\'d have to say something to her. He cleared his throatnervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven\\'t heard from your sisterlately, have you?\"5As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\\nthey normally pretended she didn\\'t have a sister.\\n\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\\n\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting\\nstars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\"\\n\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you\\nknow... her crowd.\"\\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\\nwhether he dared tell her he\\'d heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided hedidn\\'t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son --he\\'d be about Dudley\\'s age now, wouldn\\'t he?\"\\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\\n\"What\\'s his name again? Howard, isn\\'t it?\"\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite\\nagree.\"\\nHe didn\\'t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\\nWhile Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroomwindow and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for\\nsomething.\\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\\nPotters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of-- well, he didn\\'t think he could bear it.\\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\\nDursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting\\nthought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters wereinvolved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about6them and their kind.... He couldn\\'t see how he and Petunia could get\\nmixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over-- it couldn\\'t affect them....\\nHow very wrong he was.\\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat\\non the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting asstill as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner ofPrivet Drive. It didn\\'t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on thenext street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearlymidnight before the cat moved at all.\\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\\nsuddenly and silently you\\'d have thought he\\'d just popped out of theground. The cat\\'s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\\nthin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which\\nwere both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes,\\na purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moonspectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had beenbroken at least twice. This man\\'s name was Albus Dumbledore.\\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\\'t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\\nbusy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem torealize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. Forsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled andmuttered, \"I should have known.\"\\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\\nsilver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, andclicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. Heclicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve timeshe clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole streetwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat\\nwatching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed\\nMrs. Dursley, they wouldn\\'t be able to see anything that was happeningdown on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside hiscloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down7on the wall next to the cat. He didn\\'t look at it, but after a moment he\\nspoke to it.\\n\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling\\nat a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly\\nthe shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, waswearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tightbun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\\n\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\\n\"My dear Professor, I \\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\\n\"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\n\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\"Oh yes, everyone\\'s celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.\\n\"You\\'d think they\\'d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggleshave noticed something\\'s going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her\\nhead back at the Dursleys\\' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks\\nof owls... shooting stars.... Well, they\\'re not completely stupid. Theywere bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I\\'ll betthat was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"\\n\"You can\\'t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We\\'ve had precious\\nlittle to celebrate for eleven years.\"\\n\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\'s no\\nreason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out onthe streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,swapping rumors.\"\\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping\\nhe was going to tell her something, but he didn\\'t, so she went on. \"Afine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to havedisappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he8really has gone, Dumbledore?\"\\n\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful\\nfor. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\\n\"A what?\"\\n\"A lemon drop. They\\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\'m rather fond of\"\\n\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\\'t\\nthink this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even ifYou-Know-Who has gone -\"\\n\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him\\nby his name? All this \\'You- Know-Who\\' nonsense -- for eleven years Ihave been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who wasunsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets soconfusing if we keep saying \\'You-Know-Who.\\' I have never seen any reason\\nto be frightened of saying Voldemort\\'s name.\\n\"I know you haven \\'t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half\\nexasperated, half admiring. \"But you\\'re different. Everyone knows you\\'rethe only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"\\n\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will\\nnever have.\"\\n\"Only because you\\'re too -- well -- noble to use them.\"\"It\\'s lucky it\\'s dark. I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\\ntold me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls\\nare nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know whateveryone\\'s saying? About why he\\'s disappeared? About what finallystopped him?\"\\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\\nanxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard\\nwall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixedDumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain thatwhatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until9Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing\\nanother lemon drop and did not answer.\\n\"What they\\'re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort\\nturned up in Godric\\'s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor isthat Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they\\'re -- dead. \"\\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\\n\"Lily and James... I can\\'t believe it... I didn\\'t want to believe it...\\nOh, Albus...\"\\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I\\nknow...\" he said heavily.\\nProfessor McGonagall\\'s voice trembled as she went on. \"That\\'s not all.\\nThey\\'re saying he tried to kill the Potter\\'s son, Harry. But -- hecouldn\\'t. He couldn\\'t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,but they\\'re saying that when he couldn\\'t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\\'s\\npower somehow broke -- and that\\'s why he\\'s gone.\\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\"It\\'s -- it\\'s true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he\\'s\\ndone... all the people he\\'s killed... he couldn\\'t kill a little boy?It\\'s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the\\nname of heaven did Harry survive?\"\\n\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\\neyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a\\ngolden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.\\nIt had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were movingaround the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, becausehe put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid\\'s late. I suppose it washe who told you I\\'d be here, by the way?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to\\ntell me why you\\'re here, of all places?\"\\n\"I\\'ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\\'re the only family\\nhe has left now.\"10\"You don\\'t mean -- you can\\'t mean the people who live here?\" cried\\nProfessor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.\"Dumbledore -- you can\\'t. I\\'ve been watching them all day. You couldn\\'tfind two people who are less like us. And they\\'ve got this son -- I sawhim kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.\\nHarry Potter come and live here!\"\\n\"It\\'s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and\\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\'s older. I\\'vewritten them a letter.\"\\n\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on\\nthe wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a\\nletter? These people will never understand him! He\\'ll be famous -- alegend -- I wouldn\\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter dayin the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every childin our world will know his name!\"\\n\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his\\nhalf-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy\\'s head. Famousbefore he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\'t evenremember! CarA you see how much better off he\\'ll be, growing up awayfrom all that until he\\'s ready to take it?\"\\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and\\nthen said, \"Yes -- yes, you\\'re right, of course. But how is the boy\\ngetting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though shethought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\\n\"Hagrid\\'s bringing him.\"\\n\"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as\\nthis?\"\\nI would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.\"I\\'m not saying his heart isn\\'t in the right place,\" said Professor\\nMcGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can\\'t pretend he\\'s not careless. He does\\ntend to -- what was that?\"\\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew\\nsteadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a11headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and\\na huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front ofthem.\\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride\\nit. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times\\nas wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long\\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had handsthe size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots werelike baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundleof blankets.\\n\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did\\nyou get that motorcycle?\"\\n\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,\" said the giant, climbing\\ncarefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it tome. I\\'ve got him, sir.\"\\n\"No problems, were there?\"\\n\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right\\nbefore the Muggles started swarmin\\' around. He fell asleep as we wasflyin\\' over Bristol.\"\\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\\nblankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a\\ntuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiouslyshaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\\n\"Is that where -?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\\'ll have that scar forever.\"\\n\"Couldn\\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\"Even if I could, I wouldn\\'t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself\\nabove my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well-- give him here, Hagrid -- we\\'d better get this over with.\"\\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\\' house.\\n\"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his12great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\\nscratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like awounded dog.\\n\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you\\'ll wake the Muggles!\"\\n\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and\\nburying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\\'t stand it -- Lily an\\' James dead-- an\\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\"\\n\"Yes, yes, it\\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or\\nwe\\'ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerlyon the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to\\nthe front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out\\nof his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\'s blankets, and then came back tothe other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked atthe little bundle; Hagrid\\'s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagallblinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone fromDumbledore\\'s eyes seemed to have gone out.\\n\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\\'s that. We\\'ve no business staying\\nhere. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"\\n\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I\\'ll be takin\\' Sirius his\\nbike back. G\\'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"\\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself\\nonto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it roseinto the air and off into the night.\\n\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore,\\nnodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he\\nstopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, andtwelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that PrivetDrive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinkingaround the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see thebundle of blankets on the step of number four.\\n\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish\\nof his cloak, he was gone.13A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and\\ntidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expectastonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside hisblankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter besidehim and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he wasfamous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\' time by Mrs.\\nDursley\\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk\\nbottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded andpinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\\'t know that at this verymoment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding uptheir glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boywho lived!\"\\nCHAPTER TWO\\nTHE VANISHING GLASSNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find\\ntheir nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at\\nall. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brassnumber four on the Dursleys\\' front door; it crept into their livingroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night whenMr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only thephotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley\\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a largeblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing acomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that madethe first noise of the day.\\n\"Up! Get up! Now!\"Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\\n\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then\\nthe sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto hisback and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a14good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny\\nfeeling he\\'d had the same dream before.\\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\\n\"Nearly,\" said Harry.\\n\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\'t you\\ndare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\'s birthday.\"\\nHarry groaned.\\n\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door.\\n\"Nothing, nothing...\"Dudley\\'s birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out\\nof bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and,\\nafter pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used tospiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, andthat was where he slept.\\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table\\nwas almost hidden beneath all Dudley\\'s birthday presents. It looked as\\nthough Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the\\nsecond television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted aracing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hatedexercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\\'sfavorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\\'t often catch him. Harrydidn\\'t look it, but he was very fast.\\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\\nhad always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller andskinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothesof Dudley\\'s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harryhad a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. Hewore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of\\nall the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry\\nliked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead thatwas shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he couldremember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt15Petunia was how he had gotten it.\\n\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don\\'t ask\\nquestions.\"\\nDon\\'t ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\\nDursleys.\\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and\\nshouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts\\nthan the rest of the boys in his class put\\ntogether, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --\\nall over the place.\\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\\nmother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face,not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that laysmoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudleylooked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like apig in a wig.\\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult\\nas there wasn\\'t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.His face fell.\\n\"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two\\nless than last year.\"\\n\"Darling, you haven\\'t counted Auntie Marge\\'s present, see, it\\'s here\\nunder this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\"\\n\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face.\\nHarry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing downhis bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,\\n\"And we\\'ll buy you another two presents while we\\'re out today. How\\'sthat, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\\'\\'16Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said\\nslowly, \"So I\\'ll have thirty ... thirty...\"\\n\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia.\\n\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right\\nthen.\"\\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like\\nhis father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\'s hair.\\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\\nwhile Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a\\nvideo camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, anda VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petuniacame back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\\n\"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t\\ntake him.\" She jerked her head in Harry\\'s direction.\\nDudley\\'s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\\'s heart gave a leap. Every\\nyear on Dudley\\'s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for theday, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Everyyear, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived twostreets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage\\nand Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\\'d ever\\nowned.\\n\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\\'d\\nplanned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg hadbroken her leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself it would be\\na whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and\\nTufty again.\\n\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested.\"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\"\\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\\'t\\nthere -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\\'tunderstand them, like a slug.17\"What about what\\'s-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?\"\\n\"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia.\"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he\\'d be able to\\nwatch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go\\non Dudley\\'s computer).\\nAunt Petunia looked as though she\\'d just swallowed a lemon.\"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled.\"I won\\'t blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren\\'t listening.\\n\"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \"...\\nand leave him in the car....\"\\n\"That car\\'s new, he\\'s not sitting in it alone....\"\\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\\'t really crying -- it had\\nbeen years since he\\'d really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed uphis face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\\n\"Dinky Duddydums, don\\'t cry, Mummy won\\'t let him spoil your special\\nday!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.\\n\"I... don\\'t... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge,\\npretend sobs. \"He always sp- spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nastygrin through the gap in his mother\\'s arms.\\nJust then, the doorbell rang -- \"Oh, good Lord, they\\'re here!\" said Aunt\\nPetunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley\\'s best friend, Piers\\nPolkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face\\nlike a rat. He was usually the one who held people\\'s arms behind theirbacks while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn\\'t believe his luck, was sitting in\\nthe back of the Dursleys\\' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to thezoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\\'t been able\\nto think of anything else to do with him, but before they\\'d left, Uncle\\nVernon had taken Harry aside.\\n\"I\\'m warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up18close to Harry\\'s, \"I\\'m warning you now, boy -- any funny business,\\nanything at all -- and you\\'ll be in that cupboard from now untilChristmas.\"\\n\"I\\'m not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly..\\nBut Uncle Vernon didn\\'t believe him. No one ever did.\\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was\\njust no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\'t make them happen.\\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking\\nas though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors\\nand cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which\\nshe left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself sillyat Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day,where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as ithad been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week\\nin his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he\\ncouldn\\'t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting\\nold sweater of Dudley\\'s (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder shetried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, untilfinally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\\'t fit\\nHarry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to\\nhis great relief, Harry wasn\\'t punished.\\nOn the other hand, he\\'d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on\\nthe roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\\'s gang had been chasing him asusual when, as much to Harry\\'s surprise as anyone else\\'s, there he was\\nsitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter\\nfrom Harry\\'s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing schoolbuildings. But all he\\'d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernonthrough the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trashcans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must havecaught him in mid- jump.\\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with\\nDudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\\'t school,his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg\\'s cabbage-smelling living room.19While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to\\ncomplain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, thebank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,it was motorcycles.\\n\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a\\nmotorcycle overtook them.\\nI had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It\\nwas flying.\"\\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right\\naround in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet\\nwith a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\"\\nDudley and Piers sniggered.I know they don\\'t,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\"\\nBut he wished he hadn\\'t said anything. If there was one thing the\\nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talkingabout anything acting in a way it shouldn\\'t, no matter if it was in adream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerousideas.\\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The\\nDursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the\\nentrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harrywhat he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheaplemon ice pop. It wasn\\'t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as theywatched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,except that it wasn\\'t blond.\\nHarry had the best morning he\\'d had in a long time. He was careful to\\nwalk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, whowere starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\\'t fallback on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoorestaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbockerglory didn\\'t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him\\nanother one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to\\nlast.20After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in\\nthere, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sortsof lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood andstone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick,man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the\\nplace. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\\'s car\\nand crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn\\'t look inthe mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the\\nglistening brown coils.\\n\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the\\nglass, but the snake didn\\'t budge.\\n\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly\\nwith his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\\n\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He\\nwouldn\\'t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- nocompany except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass tryingto disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as abedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door\\nto wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised\\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\\'s.\\nIt winked.\\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\\nwatching. They weren\\'t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised\\nits eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\\n\"I get that all the time.\\n\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the\\nsnake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"21The snake nodded vigorously.\\n\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry\\npeered at it.\\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\"Was it nice there?\"The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:\\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so you\\'ve never been to\\nBrazil?\"\\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of\\nthem jump.\\n\"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU\\nWON\\'T BELIEVEWHAT IT\\'S DOING!\"\\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by\\nsurprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened\\nso fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley wereleaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back withhowls of horror.\\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\\'s tank\\nhad vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering\\nout onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed andstarted running for the exits.\\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,\\nhissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"\\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\\n\"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\"22The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea\\nwhile he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could onlygibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\\'t done anything exceptsnap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they wereall back in Uncle Vernon\\'s car, Dudley was telling them how it hadnearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to\\nsqueeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers\\ncalming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren\\'t you,Harry?\"\\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\\nstarting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed tosay, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a\\nchair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He\\ndidn\\'t know what time it was and he couldn\\'t be sure the Dursleys wereasleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\\'t risk sneaking to the kitchenfor some food.\\nHe\\'d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as\\nlong as he could remember, ever since he\\'d been a baby and his parentshad died in that car crash. He couldn\\'t remember being in the car whenhis parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during longhours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blindingflash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he\\nsupposed, was the crash, though he couldn\\'t imagine where all the green\\nlight came from. He couldn\\'t remember his parents at all. His aunt anduncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to askquestions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\\nrelation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangersthey were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him oncewhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harryfuriously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of theshop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in\\ngreen had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long\\npurple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day andthen walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all thesepeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a23closer look.\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\\'s gang hated\\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, andnobody liked to disagree with Dudley\\'s gang.\\nCHAPTER THREE\\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONEThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his\\nlongest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard\\nagain, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his\\nnew video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first timeout on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed PrivetDrive on her crutches.\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\\'s gang,\\nwho visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest andstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quitehappy to join in Dudley\\'s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he\\ncould see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off\\nto secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\\'t bewith Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\\'s old privateschool, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on theother hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudleythought this was very funny.\\n\"They stuff people\\'s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\"\\nhe told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\"\\n\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet\\'s never had anything as\\nhorrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, beforeDudley could work out what he\\'d said.\\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings\\nuniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\\'s. Mrs. Figg wasn \\'t as bad asusual. It turned out she\\'d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,24and she didn\\'t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch\\ntelevision and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as thoughshe\\'d had it for several years.\\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\\nhis brand-new uniform. Smeltings\\' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange\\nknickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried\\nknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\\'tlooking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said\\ngruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burstinto tears and said she couldn\\'t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he\\nlooked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\\'t trust himself to speak. He\\nthought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not tolaugh.\\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry\\nwent in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in\\nthe sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like\\ndirty rags swimming in gray water.\\n\"What\\'s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always\\ndid if he dared to ask a question.\\n\"Your new school uniform,\" she said.\\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn\\'t realize it had to be so wet.\"\"DotA be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I\\'m dyeing some of Dudley\\'s old\\nthings gray for you. It\\'ll look just like everyone else\\'s when I\\'ve\\nfinished.\"\\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat\\ndown at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to lookon his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of oldelephant skin, probably.\\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the\\nsmell from Harry\\'s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper asusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,25on the table.\\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the\\ndoormat.\\n\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\\n\"Make Harry get it.\"\\n\"Get the mail, Harry.\"\"Make Dudley get it.\"\\n\"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\"\\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things\\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\\'s sister Marge, who wasvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like abill, and -- a letter for Harry.\\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant\\nelastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Whowould? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn\\'t belong to thelibrary, so he\\'d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yethere it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\\nMr. H. Potter\\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs4 Privet Drive\\nLittle Whinging\\nSurreyThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the\\naddress was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax\\nseal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snakesurrounding a large letter H.26\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you\\ndoing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke.\\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed\\nUncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began toopen the yellow envelope.\\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over\\nthe postcard.\\n\"Marge\\'s ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk. --.\"\"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry\\'s got something!\"\\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the\\nsame heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out ofhis hand by Uncle Vernon.\\n\"That\\'s mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\\n\"Who\\'d be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open\\nwith one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green fasterthan a set of traffic lights. And it didn\\'t stop there. Within secondsit was the grayish white of old porridge.\\n\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.\\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it\\nhigh out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the firstline. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched herthroat and made a choking noise.\\n\"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!\"\\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\\nDudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\\'t used to being ignored. Hegave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\\n\"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. want to read it,\" said\\nHarry furiously, \"as it\\'s mine.\"\\n\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back\\ninside its envelope.27Harry didn\\'t move.\\nI WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted.\"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley.\\n\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\\nscruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming thekitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious butsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry,his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen atthe crack between door and floor.\\n\"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the\\naddress -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\\'t thinkthey\\'re watching the house?\"\\n\"Watching -- spying -- might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon\\nwildly.\\n\"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\\'t\\nwant --\"\\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon\\'s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the\\nkitchen.\\n\"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we\\'ll ignore it. If they don\\'t get an\\nanswer... Yes, that\\'s best... we won\\'t do anything....\\n\"But --\"\\n\"I\\'m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\\'t we swear when we took\\nhim in we\\'d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\"\\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\\'d\\nnever done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\\n\"Where\\'s my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed\\nthrough the door. \"Who\\'s writing to me?\"\\n\"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly.\\n\"I have burned it.\"28\"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\"\\n\"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the\\nceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into asmile, which looked quite painful.\\n\"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been\\nthinking... you\\'re really getting a bit big for it... we think it mightbe nice if you moved into Dudley\\'s second bedroom.\\n\"Why?\" said Harry.\\n\"Don\\'t ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs,\\nnow.\"\\nThe Dursleys\\' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\\nPetunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\\'s sister, Marge), onewhere Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things\\nthat wouldn\\'t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip\\nupstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. Hesat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here wasbroken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, workingtank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\\'s dog; in thecorner was Dudley\\'s first-ever television set, which he\\'d put his footthrough when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large\\nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school\\nfor a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bentbecause Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. Theywere the only things in the room that looked as though they\\'d never beentouched.\\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don\\'t\\nwant him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"\\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\\'d have given\\nanything to be up here. Today he\\'d rather be back in his cupboard withthat letter than up here without it.\\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in\\nshock. He\\'d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, beensick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through thegreenhouse roof, and he still didn\\'t have his room back. Harry was29thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\\'d opened the\\nletter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at eachother darkly.\\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\\nto Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with\\nhis Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There\\'s\\nanother one! \\'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --\\'\"\\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\\nhall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to theground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the factthat Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a\\nminute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the\\nSmelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, withHarry\\'s letter clutched in his hand.\\n\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry.\\n\"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"\\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out\\nof his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\\'t received his firstletter. Surely that meant they\\'d try again? And this time he\\'d make surethey didn\\'t fail. He had a plan.\\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o\\'clock the next morning. Harry\\nturned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\\'t wake the\\nDursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and\\nget the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he creptacross the dark hall toward the front door --\\nHarry leapt into the air; he\\'d trodden on something big and squashy on\\nthe doormat -- something alive!\\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the\\nbig, squashy something had been his uncle\\'s face. Uncle Vernon had beenlying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making\\nsure that Harry didn\\'t do exactly what he\\'d been trying to do. He\\nshouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and makea cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by thetime he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\\'s lap.30Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\\nI want --\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\\npieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. Hestayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\\n\"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if\\nthey can\\'t deliver them they\\'ll just give up.\"\\n\"I\\'m not sure that\\'ll work, Vernon.\"\"Oh, these people\\'s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\\'re not\\nlike you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the\\npiece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they\\ncouldn\\'t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the smallwindow in the downstairs bathroom.\\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\\nout a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front andback doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\"as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to\\nHarry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each\\nof the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed AuntPetunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furioustelephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someoneto complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\\n\"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in\\namazement.\\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\\ntired and rather ill, but happy.\\n\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade\\non his newspapers, \"no damn letters today --\"\\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught\\nhim sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty31letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys\\nducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.\\n\"Out! OUT!\"Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.\\nWhen Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their\\nfaces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the lettersstill streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\\n\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling\\ngreat tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all backhere in five minutes ready to leave. We\\'re going away. Just pack some\\nclothes. No arguments!\"\\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared\\nargue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through theboarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the\\nhead for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and\\ncomputer in his sports bag.\\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\\'t dare ask where they\\nwere going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn anddrive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake\\'em off... shake \\'emoff,\" he would mutter whenever he did this.\\nThey didn\\'t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was\\nhowling. He\\'d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\\'dmissed five television programs he\\'d wanted to see, and he\\'d never goneso long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the\\noutskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin bedsand damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting onthe windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars andwondering....\\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for\\nbreakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the\\nhotel came over to their table.\\n\"\\'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an \\'undred32of these at the front desk.\"\\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:Mr. H. Potter\\nRoom 17\\nRailview HotelCokeworthHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out\\nof the way. The woman stared.\\n\"I\\'ll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following\\nher from the dining room.\\nWouldn\\'t it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested\\ntimidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\\'t seem to hear her. Exactly\\nwhat he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into themiddle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back inthe car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middleof a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top ofa multilevel parking garage.\\n\"Daddy\\'s gone mad, hasn\\'t he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that\\nafternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all insidethe car, and disappeared.\\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley\\nsniveled.\\n\"It\\'s Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto\\'s on tonight. I\\nwant to stay somewhere with a television. \"\\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you\\ncould usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because oftelevision -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\\'s eleventh birthday. Of\\ncourse, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys\\nhad given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\\'s old socks.Still, you weren\\'t eleven every day.33Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,\\nthin package and didn\\'t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\\'dbought.\\n\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"\\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\\nlooked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock wasthe most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing wascertain, there was no television in there.\\n\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his\\nhands together. \"And this gentleman\\'s kindly agreed to lend us his\\nboat!\"\\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather\\nwicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water belowthem.\\n\"I\\'ve already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\"\\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their\\nnecks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed likehours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding,led the way to the broken-down house.\\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind\\nwhistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace wasdamp and empty. There were only two rooms.\\nUncle Vernon\\'s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\\nbananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked\\nand shriveled up.\\n\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully.He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance\\nof reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privatelyagreed, though the thought didn\\'t cheer him up at all.\\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the\\nhigh waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled thefilthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second34room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle\\nVernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to findthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,most ragged blanket.\\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry\\ncouldn\\'t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable,\\nhis stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\\'s snores were drowned by thelow rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial ofDudley\\'s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fatwrist, told Harry he\\'d be eleven in ten minutes\\' time. He lay andwatched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys wouldremember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the\\nroof wasn\\'t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full ofletters when they got back that he\\'d be able to steal one somehow.\\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like\\nthat? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Wasthe rock crumbling into the sea?\\nOne minute to go and he\\'d be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...\\nnine -- maybe he\\'d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two...one...\\nBOOM.\\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the\\ndoor. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\\nCHAPTER FOUR\\nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYSBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where\\'s the cannon?\" he\\nsaid stupidly.\\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the\\nroom. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had beenin the long, thin package he had brought with them.35\"Who\\'s there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you -- I\\'m armed!\"\\nThere was a pause. Then --SMASH!\\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\\nwith a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost\\ncompletely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangledbeard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles\\nunder all the hair.\\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just\\nbrushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted iteasily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped alittle. He turned to look at them all.\\n\"Couldn\\'t make us a cup o\\' tea, could yeh? It\\'s not been an easy\\njourney...\"\\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger.\\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,\\nterrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\\n\"An\\' here\\'s Harry!\" said the giant.\\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the\\nbeetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\\n\"Las\\' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a\\nlot like yet dad, but yeh\\'ve got yet mom\\'s eyes.\"\\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\\nI demand that you leave at once, sit!\" he said. \"You are breaking and\\nentering!\"36\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over\\nthe back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hands, bentit into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw itinto a corner of the room.\\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\\n\"Anyway -- Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a\\nvery happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat onit at some point, but it\\'ll taste all right.\"\\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly\\nsquashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a\\nlarge, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in\\ngreen icing.\\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words\\ngot lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who areyou?\"\\nThe giant chuckled.\\n\"True, I haven\\'t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and\\nGrounds at Hogwarts.\"\\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\\'s whole arm.\\n\"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together.\\n\"I\\'d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\\'ve got it, mind.\"\\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and\\nhe snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\\'t see what he\\nwas doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire\\nthere. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry feltthe warmth wash over him as though he\\'d sunk into a hot bath.\\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and\\nbegan taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: acopper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several\\nchipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from\\nbefore starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound andsmell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant wasworking, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt37sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said\\nsharply, \"Don\\'t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\"\\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\"Yet great puddin\\' of a son don\\' need fattenin\\' anymore, Dursley, don\\'\\nworry.\"\\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted\\nanything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\'t take his eyes off thegiant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,\"I\\'m sorry, but I still don\\'t really know who you are.\"\\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his\\nhand.\\n\"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An\\' like I told yeh, I\\'m\\nKeeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh\\'ll know all about Hogwarts, o\\' course.\\n\"Er -- no,\" said Harry.\\nHagrid looked shocked.\"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly.\"Sony?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back\\ninto the shadows. \"It\\' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\\'t\\ngettin\\' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\\'t even know abou\\'Hogwarts, fer cryin\\' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parentslearned it all?\"\\n\"All what?\" asked Harry.\\n\"ALL WHAT?\" Hagrid thundered. \"Now wait jus\\' one second!\"\\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.\\nThe Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\\n\"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy --\\nthis boy! -- knows nothin\\' abou\\' -- about ANYTHING?\"\\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after\\nall, and his marks weren\\'t bad.38\"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\" But\\nHagrid simply waved his hand and said, \"About our world, I mean. Yourworld. My world. Yer parents\\' world.\"\\n\"What world?\"\\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\\n\"DURSLEY!\" he boomed.Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded\\nlike \"Mimblewimble.\" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\\n\"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they\\'re\\nfamous. You\\'re famous.\"\\n\"What? My -- my mom and dad weren\\'t famous, were they?\"\\n\"Yeh don\\' know... yeh don\\' know...\" Hagrid ran his fingers through his\\nhair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\\n\"Yeh don\\' know what yeh are?\" he said finally.Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\\n\"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the\\nboy anything!\"\\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious\\nlook Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembledwith rage.\\n\"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore\\nleft fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\\'you\\'ve kept it from him all these years?\"\\n\"Kept what from me?\" said Harry eagerly.\\n\"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.39\"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry -- yet a\\nwizard.\"\\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind\\ncould be heard.\\n\"-- a what?\" gasped Harry.\\n\"A wizard, o\\' course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which\\ngroaned and sank even lower, \"an\\' a thumpin\\' good\\'un, I\\'d say, onceyeh\\'ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\\' dad like yours, what elsewould yeh be? An\\' I reckon it\\'s abou\\' time yeh read yer letter.\"\\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,\\naddressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock,The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme\\nMugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts\\nSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of allnecessary books and equipment.\\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\\nYours sincerely,\\nMinerva McGonagall,\\nDeputy HeadmistressQuestions exploded inside Harry\\'s head like fireworks and he couldn\\'t\\ndecide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does\\nit mean, they await my owl?\"\\n\"Gallopin\\' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to\\nhis forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet40another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live,\\nrather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry couldread upside down:\\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\\nGiven Harry his letter.\\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.Weather\\'s horrible. Hope you\\'re Well.\\nHagrid\\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its\\nbeak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then hecame back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on thetelephone.\\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\\n\"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still\\nashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\n\"He\\'s not going,\" he said.\\nHagrid grunted.\\n\"I\\'d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said.\"A what?\" said Harry, interested.\\n\"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it\\'s what we call nonmagic folk like thern.\\nAn\\' it\\'s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\\' the biggest Muggles Iever laid eyes on.\"\\n\"We swore when we took him in we\\'d put a stop to that rubbish,\" said\\nUncle Vernon, \"swore we\\'d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\"\\n\"You knew?\" said Harry. \"You knew I\\'m a -- a wizard?\"\\n\"Knew!\" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \"Knew! Of course we knew! How41could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a\\nletter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and camehome every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacupsinto rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak!But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that,they were proud of having a witch in the family!\"\\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed\\nshe had been wanting to say all this for years.\\n\"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and\\nhad you, and of course I knew you\\'d be just the same, just as strange,just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got\\nherself blown up and we got landed with you!\"\\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \"Blown\\nup? You told me they died in a car crash!\"\\n\"CAR CRASH!\" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys\\nscuttled back to their corner. \"How could a car crash kill Lily an\\'\\nJames Potter? It\\'s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\\' hisown story when every kid in our world knows his name!\" \"But why? Whathappened?\" Harry asked urgently.\\nThe anger faded from Hagrid\\'s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\\n\"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no\\nidea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\\' hold ofyeh, how much yeh didn\\'t know. Ah, Harry, I don\\' know if I\\'m the rightperson ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can\\'t go off terHogwarts not knowin\\'.\"\\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\n\"Well, it\\'s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can\\'t\\ntell yeh everythin\\', it\\'s a great myst\\'ry, parts of it....\"\\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \"It\\nbegins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it\\'s incredible\\nyeh don\\'t know his name, everyone in our world knows --\"\\n\"Who? \"42\"Well -- I don\\' like sayin\\' the name if I can help it.

You was just a year old.\\nHe came ter yer house an\\' -- an\\' --\"\\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew\\nhis nose with a sound like a foghorn.\\n\"Sorry,\" he said. \"But it\\'s that sad -- knew yer mum an\\' dad, an\\' nicer\\npeople yeh couldn\\'t find -- anyway...\"\\n\"You-Know-Who killed \\'em. An\\' then -- an\\' this is the real myst\\'ry of\\nthe thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job ofit, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\\' by then. But he couldn\\'t43do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no\\nordinary cut. That\\'s what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touchesyeh -- took care of yer mum an\\' dad an\\' yer house, even -- but it didn\\'twork on you, an\\' that\\'s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived afterhe decided ter kill \\'em, no one except you, an\\' he\\'d killed some o\\' thebest witches an\\' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the\\nPrewetts -- an\\' you was only a baby, an\\' you lived.\"\\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry\\'s mind. As Hagrid\\'s story\\ncame to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, moreclearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he rememberedsomething else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruellaugh.\\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\\n\"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\\'s orders. Brought\\nyeh ter this lot...\"\\n\"Load of old tosh,\" said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost\\nforgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed tohave got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists wereclenched.\\n\"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept there\\'s something\\nstrange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\\'t have cured\\n-- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no\\ndenying it, and the world\\'s better off without them in my opinion --asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types --just what I expected, always knew they\\'d come to a sticky end --\"\\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink\\numbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a\\nsword, he said, \"I\\'m warning you, Dursley -I\\'m warning you -- one moreword... \"\\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant,\\nUncle Vernon\\'s courage failed again; he flattened himself against thewall and fell silent.\\n\"That\\'s better,\" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on\\nthe sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.44Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\\n\"But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?\"\"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter\\nkill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\\'s the biggest myst\\'ry, see...\\nhe was gettin\\' more an\\' more powerful -- why\\'d he go?\\n\"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough\\nhuman left in him to die. Some say he\\'s still out there, bidin\\' histime, like, but I don\\' believe it. People who was on his side came backter ours. Some of \\'em came outta kinda trances. Don~ reckon theycould\\'ve done if he was comin\\' back.\\n\"Most of us reckon he\\'s still out there somewhere but lost his powers.\\nToo weak to carry on. \\'Cause somethin\\' about you finished him, Harry.There was somethin\\' goin\\' on that night he hadn\\'t counted on -- I dunnowhat it was, no one does -- but somethin\\' about you stumped him, allright.\"\\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but\\nHarry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there hadbeen a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\\'dspent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia andUncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\\'t they been turnedinto warty toads every time they\\'d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If\\nhe\\'d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley\\nhad always been able to kick him around like a football?\\n\"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I\\ndon\\'t think I can be a wizard.\"\\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n\"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or\\nangry?\"\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd\\nthing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had\\nhappened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley\\'s\\ngang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading goingto school with that ridiculous haircut, he\\'d managed to make it growback... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn\\'t he got his45revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn\\'t he set a boa\\nconstrictor on him?\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively\\nbeaming at him.\\n\"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you\\'ll be\\nright famous at Hogwarts.\"\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn\\'t going to give in without a fight.\"Haven\\'t I told you he\\'s not going?\" he hissed. \"He\\'s going to Stonewall\\nHigh and he\\'ll be grateful for it. I\\'ve read those letters and he needs\\nall sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --\"\\n\"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\\'t stop him,\" growled\\nHagrid. \"Stop Lily an\\' James Potter\\' s son goin\\' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad.His name\\'s been down ever since he was born. He\\'s off ter the finestschool of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he\\nwon\\'t know himself. He\\'ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a\\nchange, an\\' he\\'ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever hadAlbus Dumbled--\"\\n\"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM\\nMAGIC TRICKS!\"yelled Uncle Vernon.\\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled\\nit over his head, \"NEVER,\" he thundered, \"- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE-IN- FRONT- OF- ME!\"\\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley\\n-- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a\\nsharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot withhis hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turnedhis back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\\'s tail poking through a hole inhis trousers.\\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other\\nroom, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door\\nbehind them.\\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.46\"Shouldn\\'ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn\\'t work\\nanyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much likea pig anyway there wasn\\'t much left ter do.\"\\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\\n\"Be grateful if yeh didn\\'t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he\\nsaid. \"I\\'m -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\\'. I wasallowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\\' get yer letters to yeh an\\' stuff-- one o\\' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job\\n\"Why aren\\'t you supposed to do magic?\" asked Harry.\\n\"Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter\\ntell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\\'everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man,Dumbledore.\" \"Why were you expelled?\"\\n\"It\\'s gettin\\' late and we\\'ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\" said Hagrid\\nloudly. \"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\\' that.\"\\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\"You can kip under that,\" he said. \"Don\\' mind if it wriggles a bit, I\\nthink I still got a couple o\\' dormice in one o\\' the pockets.\"\\nCHAPTER FIVE\\nDIAGON ALLEY\\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was\\ndaylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\\n\"It was a dream, he told himself firmly. \"I dreamed a giant called\\nHagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I openmy eyes I\\'ll be at home in my cupboard.\"\\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\\nAnd there\\'s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart\\nsinking. But he still didn\\'t open his eyes. It had been such a good47dream.\\nTap. Tap. Tap.\"All right,\" Harry mumbled, \"I\\'m getting up.\"\\nHe sat up and Hagrid\\'s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of\\nsunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsedsofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaperheld in its beak.\\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon\\nwas swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it\\nopen. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who\\ndidn\\'t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began toattack Hagrid\\'s coat.\\n\"Don\\'t do that.\"\\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak\\nfiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\\n\"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There\\'s an owl\"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n\"What?\"\\n\"He wants payin\\' fer deliverin\\' the paper. Look in the pockets.\"\\nHagrid\\'s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches ofkeys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\\n\"Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily.\\n\"Knuts?\"\"The little bronze ones.\"\\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg\\nso Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Thenhe flew off through the open window.48Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\n\"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\\' buy\\nall yer stuff fer school.\"\\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just\\nthought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon\\ninside him had got a puncture.\\n\"Um -- Hagrid?\"\"Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\\n\"I haven\\'t got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he\\nwon\\'t pay for me to go and learn magic.\"\\n\"Don\\'t worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his\\nhead. \"D\\'yeh think yer parents didn\\'t leave yeh anything?\"\\n\"But if their house was destroyed --\"\\n\"They didn\\' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is\\nGringotts. Wizards\\' bank. Have a sausage, they\\'re not bad cold -- an\\' Iwouldn\\' say no teh a bit o\\' yer birthday cake, neither.\"\\n\"Wizards have banks?\"\\n\"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\"\\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\"Goblins?\"\\n\"Yeah -- so yeh\\'d be mad ter try an\\' rob it, I\\'ll tell yeh that. Never\\nmess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world feranything yeh want ter keep safe -- \\'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\\'fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwartsbusiness.\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \"He usually gets me ter doimportant stuff fer him. Fetchin\\' you gettin\\' things from Gringotts --\\nknows he can trust me, see.\\n\"Got everythin\\'? Come on, then.\"49Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and\\nthe sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired wasstill there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\\n\"How did you get here?\" Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\\n\"Flew,\" said Hagrid.\\n\"Flew?\"\\n\"Yeah -- but we\\'ll go back in this. Not s\\'pposed ter use magic now I\\'ve\\ngot yeh.\"\\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to\\nimagine him flying.\\n\"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of\\nhis sideways looks. \"If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, wouldyeh mind not mentionin\\' it at Hogwarts?\"\\n\"Of course not,\" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out\\nthe pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, andthey sped off toward land.\\n\"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\" Harry asked.\"Spells -- enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he\\nspoke. \"They say there\\'s dragons guardin\\' the highsecurity vaults. And\\nthen yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles underLondon, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\\'d die of hunger tryin\\' terget out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\"\\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the\\nDaily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to\\nbe left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\\'d neverhad so many questions in his life.\\n\"Ministry o\\' Magic messin\\' things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered, turning\\nthe page.\\n\"There\\'s a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop\\nhimself.\\n\"\\'Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 \\'50course, but he\\'d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the\\njob. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owlsevery morning, askin\\' fer advice.\"\\n\"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\"\\n\"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\\'s still\\nwitches an\\' wizards up an\\' down the country.\"\\n\"Why?\"\"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone\\'d be wantin\\' magic solutions to their\\nproblems. Nah, we\\'re best left alone.\"\\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid\\nfolded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto thestreet.\\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town\\nto the station. Harry couldn\\'t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as\\ntall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things likeparking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things these Mugglesdream up, eh?\"\\n\"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say\\nthere are dragons at Gringotts?\"\\n\"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I\\'d like a dragon.\"\\n\"You\\'d like one?\"\"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go.\"\\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in five\\nminutes\\' time. Hagrid, who didn\\'t understand \"Muggle money,\" as hecalled it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and\\nsat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.\\n\"Still got yer letter, Harry?\" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry\\ntook the parchment envelope out of his pocket.51\"Good,\" said Hagrid. \"There\\'s a list there of everything yeh need.\"\\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\\'t noticed the night\\nbefore, and read:\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\nUNIFORM\\nFirst-year students will require:1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\\n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\\n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)4.

Although Hagrid seemed to know\\nwhere he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an\\nordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, andcomplained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n\"I don\\'t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they\\nclimbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road linedwith shops.\\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do\\nwas keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if itcould sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full ofordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles\\nbeneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and\\nbroomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys hadcooked up? If Harry hadn\\'t known that the Dursleys had no sense ofhumor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everythingHagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\\'t helptrusting him.\\n\"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron. It\\'s a\\nfamous place.\"\\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\\'t pointed it out,53Harry wouldn\\'t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\\'t\\nglance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to therecord shop on the other as if they couldn\\'t see the Leaky Cauldron atall. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he andHagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steeredhim inside.\\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\\nsitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them wassmoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the oldbartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. Thelow buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to knowHagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a\\nglass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"\\n\"Can\\'t, Tom, I\\'m on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great\\nhand on Harry\\'s shoulder and making Harry\\'s knees buckle.\\n\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this\\nbe --?\"\\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\\n\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what an\\nhonor.\"\\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his\\nhand, tears in his eyes.\\n\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"\\nHarry didn\\'t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old\\nwoman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.Hagrid was beaming.\\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry\\nfound himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n\"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\\'t believe I\\'m meeting you at last.\"\\n\"So proud, Mr. Potter, I\\'m just so proud.\"54\"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I\\'m all of a flutter.\"\\n\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can\\'t tell you, Diggle\\'s the name, Dedalus\\nDiggle.\"\\n\"I\\'ve seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\\'s top hat fell off\\nin his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\"\\n\"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did\\nyou hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again --Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes\\nwas twitching.\\n\"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be\\none of your teachers at Hogwarts.\"\\n\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\\'s hand,\\n\"c-can\\'t t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you.\"\\n\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\"\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as\\nthough he\\'d rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh,\\nP-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You\\'ll be g-getting all your\\nequipment, I suppose? I\\'ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought.\\nBut the others wouldn\\'t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It\\ntook almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid\\nmanaged to make himself heard over the babble.\\n\"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\"Doris Crockford shook Harry\\'s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them\\nthrough the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there wasnothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\\n\"Told yeh, didn\\'t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell55was tremblin\\' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he\\'s usually tremblin\\'.\"\\n\"Is he always that nervous?\"\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was\\nstudyin\\' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand\\nexperience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and therewas a nasty bit o\\' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where\\'s meumbrella?\"\\nVampires? Hags? Harry\\'s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was\\ncounting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\\n\"Three up... two across he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\"He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\\nThe brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a\\nsmall hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later theywere facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto acobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\\n\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\"\\nHe grinned at Harry\\'s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry\\nlooked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantlyback into solid wall.\\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.\\nCauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring\\n-- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\\n\"Yeah, you\\'ll be needin\\' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money\\nfirst.\"\\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every\\ndirection as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at\\nonce: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their\\nshopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head asthey passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\\'remad....\"56A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl\\nEmporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys ofabout Harry\\'s age had their noses pressed against a window withbroomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new NimbusTwo Thousand -- fastest ever --\" There were shops selling robes, shops\\nselling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen\\nbefore, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\\' eyes,tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potionbottles, globes of the moon....\\n\"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.\\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\\nlittle shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing auniform of scarlet and gold, was -\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\\nstone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.\\nHe had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very\\nlong fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they werefacing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engravedupon them:\\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\\nFor those who take, but do not earn,Must pay most dearly in their turn.\\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\\nA treasure that was never yours,Thief, you have been warned, bewareOf finding more than treasure there.\\n\"Like I said, Yeh\\'d be mad ter try an\\' rob it,\" said Hagrid.\\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a57vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high\\nstools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighingcoins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet moregoblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry madefor the counter.\\n\"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We\\'ve come ter take some money\\noutta Mr. Harry Potter\\'s safe.\"\\n\"You have his key, Sir?\"\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\\npockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits\\nover the goblin\\'s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harrywatched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big asglowing coals.\\n\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\\n\"That seems to be in order.\"\"An\\' I\\'ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid\\nimportantly, throwing out his chest. \"It\\'s about the YouKnow-What in\\nvault seven hundred and thirteen.\"\\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have Someone\\ntake you down to both vaults. Griphook!\"\\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\\nbiscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook towardone of the doors leading off the hall.\\n\"What\\'s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry\\nasked.\\n\"Can\\'t tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts\\nbusiness. Dumbledore\\'s trusted me. More\\'n my job\\'s worth ter tell yehthat.\"58Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\\nmarble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit withflaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were littlerailway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart camehurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some\\ndifficulty -- and were off.\\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry\\ntried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left,but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way,because Griphook wasn\\'t steering.\\nHarry\\'s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\\nwide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of apassage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - -they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where hugestalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\\nI never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,\\n\"what\\'s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"\\n\"Stalagmite\\'s got an \\'m\\' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' ask me questions\\njust now, I think I\\'m gonna be sick.\"\\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\\ndoor in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the\\nwall to stop his knees from trembling.\\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and\\nas it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columnsof silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\\n\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.\\nAll Harry\\'s -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\\'t have known about\\nthis or they\\'d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often hadthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time therehad been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\n\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to59a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\\'s easy enough. Right,\\nthat should be enough fer a couple o\\' terms, we\\'ll keep the rest safefor yeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,please, and can we go more slowly?\"\\n\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.\\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\\ncolder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They wentrattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side totry to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned andpulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\\n\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with\\none of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\\n\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\\'d be sucked through\\nthe door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook.\\n\"How often do you check to see if anyone\\'s inside?\" Harry asked.\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\\nHarry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous\\njewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Thenhe noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying onthe floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harrylonged to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\\n\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don\\'t talk to me on the way\\nback, it\\'s best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid.\\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside\\nGringotts. Harry didn\\'t know where to run first now that he had a bagfull of money. He didn\\'t have to know how many Galleons there were to apound to know that he was holding more money than he\\'d had in his whole\\nlife -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.\\n\"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam\\nMalkin\\'s Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I60slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them\\nGringotts carts.\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered MadamMalkin\\'s shop alone, feeling nervous.\\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\\n\"Hogwarts, clear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot\\nhere -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. \"\\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on\\na footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. MadamMalkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over hishead, and began to pin it to the right length.\\n\"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry.\"My father\\'s next door buying my books and mother\\'s up the street\\nlooking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \"Then\\nI\\'m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\\'t see whyfirst years can\\'t have their own. I think I\\'ll bully father into gettingme one and I\\'ll smuggle it in somehow.\"\\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on.\\n\"No,\" said Harry.\"Play Quidditch at all?\"\\n\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\n\"I do -- Father says it\\'s a crime if I\\'m not picked to play for my\\nhouse, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\\'ll be in yet?\"\\n\"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know\\nI\\'ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being inHufflepuff, I think I\\'d leave, wouldn\\'t you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishinghe could say something a bit more interesting.61\"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the\\nfront window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointingat two large ice creams to show he couldn\\'t come in.\\n\"That\\'s Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\\'t.\\n\"He works at Hogwarts.\"\\n\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I\\'ve heard of him. He\\'s a sort of servant, isn\\'t\\nhe?\"\\n\"He\\'s the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\\nevery second.\\n\"Yes, exactly. I heard he\\'s a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the\\nschool grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,and ends up setting fire to his bed.\"\\n\"I think he\\'s brilliant,\" said Harry coldly.\\n\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where\\nare your parents?\"\\n\"They\\'re dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn\\'t feel much like going into\\nthe matter with this boy.\\n\"Oh, sorry,\" said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were\\nour kind, weren\\'t they?\"\\n\"They were a witch and wizard, if that\\'s what you mean.\"\"I really don\\'t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\\'re\\njust not the same, they\\'ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some\\nof them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.What\\'s your surname, anyway?\"\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That\\'s you done, my\\ndear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy,\\nhopped down from the footstool.\\n\"Well, I\\'ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy.62Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\\n(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Hagrid.\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry\\ncheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you\\nwrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what\\'s Quidditch?\"\\n\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\\' how little yeh know -- not knowin\\'\\nabout Quidditch!\"\\n\"Don\\'t make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate\\nboy in Madam Malkin\\'s.\\n\"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\\'t even be allowed\\nin.\"\\n\"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he\\'d known who yeh were -- he\\'s grown\\nup knowin\\' yer name if his parents are wizardin\\' folk. You saw what\\neveryone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, whatdoes he know about it, some o\\' the best I ever saw were the only oneswith magic in \\'em in a long line 0\\' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Lookwhat she had fer a sister!\"\\n\"So what is Quidditch?\"\\n\"It\\'s our sport. Wizard sport. It\\'s like -- like soccer in the Muggle\\nworld -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air onbroomsticks and there\\'s four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules.\"\"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\"\\n\"School houses. There\\'s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\\'\\nduffers, but --\"\\n\"I bet I\\'m in Hufflepuff\" said Harry gloomily.\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There\\'s not a\\nsingle witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\\'t in Slytherin.\\nYou-Know-Who was one.\"\\n\"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\"63\"Years an\\' years ago,\" said Hagrid.\\nThey bought Harry\\'s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\\nwhere the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large aspaving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps incovers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with\\nnothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have\\nbeen wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to dragHarry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends andBefuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\\n\"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\"\\n\"I\\'m not sayin\\' that\\'s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the\\nMuggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\'anyway, yeh couldn\\' work any of them curses yet, yeh\\'ll need a lot morestudy before yeh get ter that level.\"\\nHagrid wouldn\\'t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says\\npewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighingpotion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visitedthe Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horriblesmell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuffstood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders linedthe walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung\\nfrom the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a\\nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himselfexamined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule,glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\\'s list again.\\n\"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an\\' I still haven\\'t got yeh a birthday\\npresent.\"\\nHarry felt himself go red.\"You don\\'t have to --\"\\n\"I know I don\\'t have to. Tell yeh what, I\\'ll get yer animal. Not a toad,\\ntoads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\\'d be laughed at - an\\' I don\\'like cats, they make me sneeze. I\\'ll get yer an owl. All the kids want64owls, they\\'re dead useful, carry yer mail an\\' everythin\\'.\"\\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been\\ndark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry nowcarried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep withher head under her wing. He couldn\\'t stop stammering his thanks,\\nsounding just like Professor Quirrell.\\n\"Don\\' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don\\' expect you\\'ve had a lotta\\npresents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place ferwands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\"\\nA magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door\\nread Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand layon a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped\\ninside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair\\nthat Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he hadentered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions thathad just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrowboxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back ofhis neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tinglewith some secret magic.\\n\"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have\\njumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quicklyoff the spindly chair.\\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like\\nmoons through the gloom of the shop.\\n\"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly.\"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I\\'d be seeing you soon.\\nHarry Potter.\" It wasn\\'t a question. \"You have your mother\\'s eyes. Itseems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten\\nand a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm\\nwork.\"\\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those65silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\n\"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches.\\nPliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, Isay your father favored it -- it\\'s really the wand that chooses thewizard, of course.\"\\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to\\nnose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\\n\"And that\\'s where...\"Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\\'s forehead with a\\nlong, white finger.\\n\"I\\'m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly.\\n\"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and inthe wrong hands... well, if I\\'d known what that wand was going out intothe world to do....\"\\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry\\'s relief, spotted Hagrid.\\n\"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen\\ninches, rather bendy, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid.\\n\"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got\\nexpelled?\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\\n\"Er -- yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \"I\\'ve still\\ngot the pieces, though,\" he added brightly.\\n\"But you don\\'t use them?\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\\n\"Oh, no, sit,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink\\numbrella very tightly as he spoke.\\n\"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well, now\\n-- Mr. Potter. Let me see.\" He pulled a long tape measure with silver\\nmarkings out of his pocket. \"Which is your wand arm?\"\\n\"Er -- well, I\\'m right-handed,\" said Harry.66\"Hold out your arm. That\\'s it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to\\nfinger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and roundhis head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander wand has a core ofa powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenixtail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands\\nare the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite\\nthe same. And of course, you will never get such good results withanother wizard\\'s wand.\"\\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring\\nbetween his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander wasflitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\\n\"That will do,\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on\\nthe floor. \"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragonheartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it awave.\"\\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.\\nOllivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\\n\"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --\"Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was\\nsnatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\\n\"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.\\nGo on, go on, try it out.\"\\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting\\nfor. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the\\nspindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the\\nshelves, the happier he seemed to become.\\n\"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\\'ll find the perfect match here\\nsomewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination --holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\"\\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised\\nthe wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty airand a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and67clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very\\ngood. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... \"\\nHe put Harry\\'s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,\\nstill muttering, \"Curious... curious..\\n\"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what\\'s curious?\"\\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\"I remember every wand I\\'ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It\\nso happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gaveanother feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you\\nshould be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave\\nyou that scar.\"\\nHarry swallowed.\"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things\\nhappen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect\\ngreat things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great.\"\\nHarry shivered. He wasn\\'t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid\\nseven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from hisshop.\\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made\\ntheir way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back throughthe Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\\'t speak at all as they walkeddown the road; he didn\\'t even notice how much people were gawking atthem on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped\\npackages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\\'s lap. Up\\nanother escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realizedwhere they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\\n\"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said.He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat\\nthem. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\\n\"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid.68Harry wasn\\'t sure he could explain. He\\'d just had the best birthday of\\nhis life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find thewords.\\n\"Everyone thinks I\\'m special,\" he said at last. \"All those people in the\\nLeaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don\\'t know\\nanything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\\'m\\nfamous and I can\\'t even remember what I\\'m famous for. I don\\'t know whathappened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died.\"\\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he\\nwore a very kind smile.\\n\"Don\\' you worry, Harry. You\\'ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the\\nbeginning at Hogwarts, you\\'ll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it\\'shard. Yeh\\'ve been singled out, an\\' that\\'s always hard. But yeh\\'ll have agreat time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, \\'smatter of fact.\"\\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the\\nDursleys, then handed him an envelope.\\n\"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, \" he said. \"First o\\' September -- King\\'s Cross\\n-- it\\'s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me aletter with yer owl, she\\'ll know where to find me.... See yeh soon,Harry.\"\\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until\\nhe was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose againstthe window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\\nCHAPTER SIX\\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\\nHarry\\'s last month with the Dursleys wasn\\'t fun. True, Dudley was now so\\nscared of Harry he wouldn\\'t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petuniaand Uncle Vernon didn\\'t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to doanything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn\\'t speak to him at all.\\nHalf terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry\\nin it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it didbecome a bit depressing after a while.69Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to\\ncall her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His schoolbooks were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into thenight, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. Itwas lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\\'t come in to vacuum anymore, becauseHedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to\\nsleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned\\nto the wall, counting down to September the first.\\nOn the last day of August he thought he\\'d better speak to his aunt and\\nuncle about getting to King\\'s Cross station the next day, so he wentdown to the living room where they were watching a quiz show ontelevision. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and\\nDudley screamed and ran from the room.\\n\"Er -- Uncle Vernon?\"Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\\n\"Er -- I need to be at King\\'s Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts.\"\\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\"Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\\n\"Thank you.\"\\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\"Funny way to get to a wizards\\' school, the train. Magic carpets all got\\npunctures, have they?\"\\nHarry didn\\'t say anything.\"Where is this school, anyway?\"\"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled\\nthe ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\\n\"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven\\no\\'clock,\" he read.70His aunt and uncle stared.\\n\"Platform what?\"\"Nine and three-quarters.\"\\n\"Don\\'t talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and\\nthree-quarters.\"\\n\"It\\'s on my ticket.\"\"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You\\'ll see.\\nYou just wait. All right, we\\'ll take you to King\\'s Cross. We\\'re going up\\nto London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\\'t bother.\"\\n\"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things\\nfriendly.\\n\"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that\\nruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\"\\nHarry woke at five o\\'clock the next morning and was too excited and\\nnervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans becausehe didn\\'t want to walk into the station in his wizard\\'s robes -- he\\'dchange on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure\\nhe had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her\\ncage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Twohours later, Harry\\'s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into theDursleys\\' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next toHarry, and they had set off.\\nThey reached King\\'s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\\'s\\ntrunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thoughtthis was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing theplatforms with a nasty grin on his face.\\n\"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform\\nshould be somewhere in the middle, but they don\\'t seem to have built it\\nyet, do they?\"\\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over\\none platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and71in the middle, nothing at all.\\n\"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He\\nleft without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.All three of them were laughing. Harry\\'s mouth went rather dry. What onearth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny\\nlooks, because of Hedwig. He\\'d have to ask someone.\\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn\\'t dare mention platform nine and\\nthree-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harrycouldn\\'t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started toget annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Gettingdesperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\\'clock, but\\nthe guard said there wasn\\'t one. In the end the guard strode away,\\nmuttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutesleft to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; hewas stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardlylift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like\\ntapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. Hewondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticketinspector\\'s stand between platforms nine and ten.\\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a\\nfew words of what they were saying.\\n\"-- packed with Muggles, of course --\"Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four\\nboys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like\\nHarry\\'s in front of him -- and they had an owl.\\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so\\ndid he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\\n\"Now, what\\'s the platform number?\" said the boys\\' mother.\\n\"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was\\nholding her hand, \"Mom, can\\'t I go... \"\\n\"You\\'re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go72first.\"\\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.\\nHarry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just asthe boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a largecrowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last\\nbackpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\\n\"Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said.\"I\\'m not Fred, I\\'m George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call\\nyourself our mother? CarA you tell I\\'m George?\"\\n\"Sorry, George, dear.\"\\n\"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called\\nafter him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later,he had gone -- but how had he done it?\\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was\\nalmost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\\'t anywhere.\\nThere was nothing else for it.\"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman.\\n\"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron\\'s new, too.\"\\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and\\ngangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is -- the thing is, I don\\'t know how to\\n--\"\\n\"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the\\nbarrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\\'t stop and don\\'t be scaredyou\\'ll crash into it, that\\'s very important. Best do it at a bit of a\\nrun if you\\'re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\"\\n\"Er -- okay,\" said Harry.73He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very\\nsolid.\\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to\\nplatforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smashright into that barrier and then he\\'d be in trouble -- leaning forward\\non his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer\\nand nearer -- he wouldn\\'t be able to stop -- the cart was out of control-- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --\\nIt didn\\'t come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet\\nsteam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A signoverhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O\\'clock. Harry looked behind him\\nand saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the\\nwords Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,\\nwhile cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owlshooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and\\nthe scraping of heavy trunks.\\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging\\nout of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I\\'ve lost my toadagain.\"\\n\"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh.\\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\"\\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him\\nshrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment\\nnear the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then startedto shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it\\nup the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it\\npainfully on his foot.\\n\"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he\\'d followed through74the barrier.\\n\"Yes, please,\" Harry panted.\"Oy, Fred! C\\'mere and help!\"\\nWith the twins\\' help, Harry\\'s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner\\nof the compartment.\\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\"What\\'s that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\\'s\\nlightning scar.\\n\"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you\\n\"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren\\'t you?\" he added to Harry.\"What?\" said Harry.\\n\"Harry Potter, \"chorused the twins.\\n\"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\"The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to\\nhis relief, a voice came floating in through the train\\'s open door.\\n\"Fred? George? Are you there?\"\\n\"Coming, Mom.\"With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the\\nred-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Theirmother had just taken out her handkerchief.\\n\"Ron, you\\'ve got something on your nose.\"\\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and\\nbegan rubbing the end of his nose.\\n\"Mom -- geroff\" He wriggled free.75\"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the\\ntwins.\\n\"Shut up,\" said Ron.\\n\"Where\\'s Percy?\" said their mother.\\n\"He\\'s coming now.\"The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his\\nbillowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badgeon his chest with the letter P on it.\\n\"Can\\'t stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I\\'m up front, the prefects have got\\ntwo compartments to themselves --\"\\n\"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of\\ngreat surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\"\\n\"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the\\nother twin. \"Once --\"\\n\"Or twice --\"\"A minute --\"\\n\"All summer --\"\\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect.\"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins.\\n\"Because he\\'s a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear,\\nwell, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there.\"\\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl\\ntelling me you\\'ve -- you\\'ve blown up a toilet or --\"\\n\"Blown up a toilet? We\\'ve never blown up a toilet.\"76\"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\"\\n\"It\\'s not funny. And look after Ron.\"\"Don\\'t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\"\\n\"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already\\nand his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\\n\"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\"Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn\\'t see him looking.\\n\"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who\\nhe is?\"\\n\"Who?\"\"Harry Potter!\"\\nHarry heard the little girl\\'s voice.\\n\"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....\"\"You\\'ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\\'t something you\\ngoggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\"\\n\"Asked him. Saw his scar. It\\'s really there - like lightning.\"\\n\"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite\\nwhen he asked how to get onto the platform.\"\\n\"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks\\nlike?\"\\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\\'t you dare. As though he needs\\nreminding of that on his first day at school.\"\\n\"All right, keep your hair on.\"\\nA whistle sounded.77\"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the\\ntrain. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, andtheir younger sister began to cry.\\n\"Don\\'t, Ginny, we\\'ll send you loads of owls.\"\\n\"We\\'ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\"\\n\"George!\"\"Only joking, Mom.\"\\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys\\' mother waving and their\\nsister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the trainuntil it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the\\ncorner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of\\nexcitement. He didn\\'t know what he was going to but it had to be better\\nthan what he was leaving behind.\\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy\\ncame in.\\n\"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.\\n\"Everywhere else is full.\"\\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then\\nlooked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\\'t looked. Harry sawhe still had a black mark on his nose.\\n\"Hey, Ron.\"\\nThe twins were back.\"Listen, we\\'re going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan\\'s got a\\ngiant tarantula down there.\"\\n\"Right,\" mumbled Ron.\\n\"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and\\nGeorge Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.78\"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut\\nbehind them.\\n\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out.\\nHarry nodded.\\n\"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\\'s jokes,\" said\\nRon. \"And have you really got -- you know...\"\\nHe pointed at Harry\\'s forehead.\\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\\n\"So that\\'s where You-Know-Who\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can\\'t remember it.\"\\n\"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly.\\n\"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\"\"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as\\nthough he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly outof the window again.\\n\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as\\ninteresting as Ron found him.\\n\"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom\\'s got a second cousin\\nwho\\'s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\"\\n\"So you must know loads of magic already.\"\\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale\\nboy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\\n\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\"\\n\"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,\\nthough. Wish I\\'d had three wizard brothers.\"79\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I\\'m the sixth\\nin our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\\'ve got a lot to live upto. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charliewas captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\\'s a prefect. Fred and George messaround a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinksthey\\'re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,\\nbut if I do, it\\'s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get\\nanything new, either, with five brothers. I\\'ve got Bill\\'s old robes,Charlie\\'s old wand, and Percy\\'s old rat.\"\\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was\\nasleep.\\n\"His name\\'s Scabbers and he\\'s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy\\ngot an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\\'t aff-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\"\\nRon\\'s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\\'d said too much, because he\\nwent back to staring out of the window.\\nHarry didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with not being able to\\nafford an owl. After all, he\\'d never had any money in his life until amonth ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\\'s oldclothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheerRon up.\\n\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn\\'t know anything about be ing a\\nwizard or about my parents or Voldemort\"\\nRon gasped.\"What?\" said Harry.\\n\"You said You-Know-Who\\'s name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and\\nimpressed. \"I\\'d have thought you, of all people --\"\\n\"I\\'m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, I\\njust never knew you shouldn\\'t. See what I mean? I\\'ve got loads tolearn.... I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that\\nhad been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I\\'m the worst in the class.\"\\n\"You won\\'t be. There\\'s loads of people who come from Muggle families and\\nthey learn quick enough.\"80While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.\\nNow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They werequiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\\ncorridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,\\n\"Anything off the cart, dears?\"\\nHarry, who hadn\\'t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\\'s ears\\nwent pink again and he muttered that he\\'d brought sandwiches. Harry wentout into the corridor.\\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he\\nhad pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as manyMars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn\\'t have Mars Bars. Whatshe did have were Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\\'s BestBlowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, LicoriceWands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his\\nlife. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid\\nthe woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped\\nit onto an empty seat.\\n\"Hungry, are you?\"\\n\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four\\nsandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She alwaysforgets I don\\'t like corned beef.\"\\n\"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on --\"\\n\"You don\\'t want this, it\\'s all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn\\'t got much\\ntime,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\"\\n\"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share\\nbefore or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,\\nsitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\\'s pasties,cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).81\"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.\\n\"They\\'re not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel thatnothing would surprise him.\\n\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I\\'m missing Agrippa.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"Oh, of course, you wouldn\\'t know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside\\nthem, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I\\'ve got aboutfive hundred, but I haven\\'t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\"\\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a\\nman\\'s face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and\\nflowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was thename Albus Dumbledore.\\n\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.\\n\"Don\\'t tell me you\\'d never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a\\nfrog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks\\nHarry turned over his card and read:ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is\\nparticularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\'s blood, and hiswork on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore\\nenjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that\\nDumbledore\\'s face had disappeared.\\n\"He\\'s gone!\"\\n\"Well, you can\\'t expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He\\'ll be\\nback. No, I\\'ve got Morgana again and I\\'ve got about six of her... do youwant it? You can start collecting.\"82Ron\\'s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be\\nunwrapped.\\n\"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people\\njust stay put in photos.\"\\n\"Do they? What, they don\\'t move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed. \"weird!\"\\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and\\ngave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs thanlooking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\\'t keephis eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, butHengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.\\nHe finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was\\nscratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans.\\n\"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say\\nevery flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all theordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then\\nyou can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-\\nflavored one once.\"\\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a\\ncorner.\\n\"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts.\"\\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,\\ncoconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and waseven brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\\'ttouch, which turned out to be pepper.\\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat\\nfields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark greenhills.\\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced\\nboy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. Helooked tearful.\\n\"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\"\\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I\\'ve lost him! He keeps getting83away from me!\"\\n\"He\\'ll turn up,\" said Harry.\"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him...\"\\nHe left.\\n\"Don\\'t know why he\\'s so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I\\'d brought a toad I\\'d\\nlose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\\'ttalk.\"\\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron\\'s lap.\\n\"He might have died and you wouldn\\'t know the difference,\" said Ron in\\ndisgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him moreinteresting, but the spell didn\\'t work. I\\'ll show you, look...\"\\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking\\nwand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the\\nend.\\n\"Unicorn hair\\'s nearly poking out. AnywayHe had just raised his \\'wand when the compartment door slid open again.\\nThe toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was\\nalready wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\\n\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville\\'s lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy\\nsort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\\n\"We\\'ve already told him we haven\\'t seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl\\nwasn\\'t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\\n\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let\\'s see it, then.\"She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\"Er -- all right.\"\\nHe cleared his throat.\\n\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\"84He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast\\nasleep.\\n\"Are you sure that\\'s a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it\\'s not very\\ngood, is it? I\\'ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\\'s\\nall worked for me. Nobody in my family\\'s magic at all, it was ever such\\na surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, Imean, it\\'s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\\'ve heard --I\\'ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope itwill be enough -- I\\'m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.\\nShe said all this very fast.\\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\\nhadn\\'t learned all the course books by heart either.\\n\"I\\'m Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered.\\n\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry.\\n\"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course -- I\\ngot a few extra books. for background reading, and you\\'re in ModernMagical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and GreatWizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\\n\"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed.\\n\"Goodness, didn\\'t you know, I\\'d have found out everything I could if it\\nwas me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what house you\\'ll be in?I\\'ve been asking around, and I hope I\\'m in Gryffindor, it sounds by farthe best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw\\nwouldn\\'t be too bad.... Anyway, we\\'d better go and look for Neville\\'s\\ntoad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\\'ll be theresoon.\"\\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\"Whatever house I\\'m in, I hope she\\'s not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his\\nwand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he\\nknew it was a dud.\"\\n\"What house are your brothers in?\" asked Harry.85\"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom\\nand Dad were in it, too. I don\\'t know what they\\'ll say if I\\'m not. Idon\\'t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me inSlytherin.\"\\n\"That\\'s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\"\\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers\\' whiskers are a bit lighter,\"\\nsaid Harry, trying to take Ron\\'s mind off houses. \"So what do youroldest brothers do now that they\\'ve left, anyway?\"\\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he\\'d finished school.\\n\"Charlie\\'s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\\'s in Africa doing\\nsomething for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about\\nGringotts? It\\'s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\\'t suppose you\\nget that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high securityvault.\"\\nHarry stared.\"Really? What happened to them?\"\\n\"Nothing, that\\'s why it\\'s such big news. They haven\\'t been caught. My\\ndad says it must\\'ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts,but they don\\'t think they took anything, that\\'s what\\'s odd. \\'Course,everyone gets scared when something like this happens in caseYou-Know-Who\\'s behind it.\"\\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a\\nprickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed thiswas all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot morecomfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying.\\n\"What\\'s your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked.\\n\"Er -- I don\\'t know any,\" Harry confessed.\\n\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it\\'s the best game in the86world --\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the\\npositions of the seven players, describing famous games he\\'d been towith his brothers and the broomstick he\\'d like to get if he had themoney. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the gamewhen the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\\'t Neville thetoadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\\nthe pale boy from Madam Malkin\\'s robe shop. He was looking at Harry witha lot more interest than he\\'d shown back in Diagon Alley.\\n\"Is it true?\" he said. \"They\\'re saying all down the train that Harry\\nPotter\\'s in this compartment. So it\\'s you, is it?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\\nthickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the paleboy, they looked like bodyguards.\\n\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly,\\nnoticing where Harry was looking. \"And my name\\'s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\"\\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco\\nMalfoy looked at him.\\n\"Think my name\\'s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father\\ntold me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than\\nthey can afford.\"\\nHe turned back to Harry. \"You\\'ll soon find out some wizarding families\\nare much better than others, Potter. You don\\'t want to go making friendswith the wrong sort. I can help you there.\"\\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry\\'s, but Harry didn\\'t take it.\\n\"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said\\ncoolly.\\nDraco Malfoy didn\\'t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale\\ncheeks.\\n\"I\\'d be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you\\'re a\\nbit politer you\\'ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\\'t knowwhat was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the87Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\\'ll rub off on you.\"\\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\\n\"Oh, you\\'re going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered.\\n\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because\\nCrabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\\n\"But we don\\'t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\\'ve eaten all our food\\nand you still seem to have some.\"\\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt\\nforward, but before he\\'d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out ahorrible yell.\\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk\\ndeep into Goyle\\'s knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\\nScabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew offand hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps theythought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\\'dheard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\\n\"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the\\nfloor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\\nI think he\\'s been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at\\nScabbers. \"No -- I don\\'t believe it -- he\\'s gone back to sleep-\"\\nAnd so he had.\\n\"You\\'ve met Malfoy before?\"\\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\"I\\'ve heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the\\nfirst to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said\\nthey\\'d been bewitched. My dad doesn\\'t believe it. He says Malfoy\\'s\\nfather didn\\'t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned toHermione. \"Can we help you with something?\"88\"You\\'d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\\'ve just been up to the\\nfront to ask the conductor, and he says we\\'re nearly there. You haven\\'tbeen fighting, have you? You\\'ll be in trouble before we even get there!\"\\n\"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would\\nyou mind leaving while we change?\"\\n\"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving\\nvery childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in asniffy voice. \"And you\\'ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did youknow?\"\\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was\\ngetting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple\\nsky. The train did seem to be slowing down.\\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.\\nRon\\'s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneaththem.\\nA voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five\\nminutes\\' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be takento the school separately.\"\\nHarry\\'s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under\\nhis freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and\\njoined the crowd thronging the corridor.\\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way\\ntoward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered inthe cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of thestudents, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs\\' years! Firs\\' years\\nover here! All right there, Harry?\"\\nHagrid\\'s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\"C\\'mon, follow me -- any more firs\\' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\\'\\nyears follow me!\"\\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a\\nsteep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harrythought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, theboy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.89\"Ye\\' all get yer firs\\' sight o\\' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over\\nhis shoulder, \"jus\\' round this bend here.\"\\nThere was a loud \"Oooooh!\"\\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.\\nPerched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling inthe starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\\n\"No more\\'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little\\nboats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followedinto their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid,\\nwho had a boat to himself. \"Right then -- FORWARD!\"\\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the\\nlake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up atthe great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearerand nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\\n\"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they\\nall bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtainof ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carriedalong a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath thecastle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where theyclambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\\n\"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the\\nboats as people climbed out of them.\\n\"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they\\nclambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\\'s lamp, coming out at\\nlast onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak\\nfront door.\\n\"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\"\\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle\\ndoor.90CHAPTER SEVEN\\nTHE SORTING HATThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green\\nrobes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\\'s first thought\\nwas that this was not someone to cross.\\n\"The firs\\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.\"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\"She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have\\nfit the whole of the Dursleys\\' house in it. The stone walls were lit\\nwith flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was toohigh to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led tothe upper floors.\\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry\\ncould hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right\\n-the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagallshowed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. Theycrowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually havedone, peering about nervously.\\n\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term\\nbanquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great\\nHall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a veryimportant ceremony because, while you are here, your house will besomething like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes withthe rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend freetime in your house common room.\\n\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\\nSlytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has producedoutstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, yourtriumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will losehouse points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points isawarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a\\ncredit to whichever house becomes yours.\\n\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\\nrest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as91you can while you are waiting.\"\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\\'s cloak, which was fastened\\nunder his left ear, and on Ron\\'s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried toflatten his hair.\\n\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\n\"Please wait quietly.\"\\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron.\\n\"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he\\nwas joking.\"\\nHarry\\'s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole\\nschool? But he didn\\'t know any magic yet -- what on earth would he haveto do? He hadn\\'t expected something like this the moment they arrived.\\nHe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,\\ntoo. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whisperingvery fast about all the spells she\\'d learned and wondering which oneshe\\'d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\\'d never been morenervous, never, not even when he\\'d had to take a school report home tothe Dursleys saying that he\\'d somehow turned his teacher\\'s wig blue. Hekept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall\\nwould come back and lead him to his doom.\\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air --\\nseveral people behind him screamed.\\n\"What the --?\"\\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just\\nstreamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent,they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancingat the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fatlittle monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give hima second chance --\"\\n\"My dear Friar, haven\\'t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He\\ngives us all a bad name and you know, he\\'s not really even a ghost -- Isay, what are you all doing here?\"92A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\\nNobody answered.\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be\\nSorted, I suppose?\"\\nA few people nodded mutely.\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you\\nknow.\"\\n\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony\\'s about to\\nstart.\"\\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away\\nthrough the opposite wall.\\n\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and\\nfollow me.\"\\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line\\nbehind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked outof the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doorsinto the Great Hall.\\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was\\nlit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midairover four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At thetop of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.\\nProfessor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a\\nhalt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in theflickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, theghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harrylooked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. Heheard\\nHermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read\\nabout it in Hogwarts, A History.\"93It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the\\nGreat Hall didn\\'t simply open on to the heavens.\\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed\\na four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool sheput a pointed wizard\\'s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and\\nextremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\\'t have let it in the house.\\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\\nthat seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall wasnow staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, therewas complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim openedwide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:\\n\"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty,\\nBut don\\'t judge on what you see,I\\'ll eat myself if you can find\\nA smarter hat than me.\\nYou can keep your bowlers black,Your top hats sleek and tall,\\nFor I\\'m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\\nAnd I can cap them all.There\\'s nothing hidden in your head\\nThe Sorting Hat can\\'t see,\\nSo try me on and I will tell youWhere you ought to be.You might belong in Gryffindor,\\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;94You might belong in Hufflepuff,\\nWhere they are just and loyal,Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;\\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\\nif you\\'ve a ready mind,Where those of wit and learning,\\nWill always find their kind;\\nOr perhaps in SlytherinYou\\'ll make your real friends,\\nThose cunning folk use any means\\nTo achieve their ends.So put me on! Don\\'t be afraid!And don\\'t get in a flap!\\nYou\\'re in safe hands (though I have none)\\nFor I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\"The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It\\nbowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\n\"So we\\'ve just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I\\'ll\\nkill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"\\nHarry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than\\nhaving to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on\\nwithout everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot;\\nHarry didn\\'t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. Ifonly the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy,that would have been the one for him.95Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\\nparchment.\\n\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to\\nbe sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\"\\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the\\nhat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause--\\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat.\\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at\\nthe Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar wavingmerrily at her.\\n\"Bones, Susan!\"\\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next\\nto Hannah.\\n\"Boot, Terry!\"\"RAVENCLAW!\"\\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws\\nstood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n\" Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\"\\nbecame the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left explodedwith cheers; Harry could see Ron\\'s twin brothers catcalling.\\n\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\\'s\\nimagination, after all he\\'d heard about Slytherin, but he thought theylooked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sicknow. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, butbecause no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\\n\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"\\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"96Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at\\nothers it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" thesandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almosta whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n\"Granger, Hermione!\"\\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when\\nyou\\'re very nervous. What if he wasn\\'t chosen at all? What if he just\\nsat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until ProfessorMcGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been amistake and he\\'d better get back on the train?\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called,\\nhe fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide\\nwith Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran offstill wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give itto \"MacDougal, Morag.\"\\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at\\nonce: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\"\\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with\\nhimself.\\nThere weren\\'t many people left now. \"Moon\" \"Nott\" \"Parkinson\" then a\\npair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" and\\nthen, at last -- \"Potter, Harry!\"\\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little\\nhissing fires all over the hall.\\n\"Potter, did she say?\"\\nThe Harry Potter?\"\\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the\\nhall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he97was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\nHmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty\\nof courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\\'s talent, A my goodness,yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\\'s interesting....So where shall I put you?\"\\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not\\nSlytherin.\\n\"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be\\ngreat, you know, it\\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help youon the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you\\'re sure\\n-- better be GRYFFINDOR!\"\\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off\\nthe hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was sorelieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticedthat he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and\\nshook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got\\nPotter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruffhe\\'d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden,horrible feeling he\\'d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.\\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat\\nHagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned\\nback. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair,\\nsat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\\'dgotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\\'s silver hairwas the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as theghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young manfrom the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple\\nturban.\\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\"\\na Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.\"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\\'s turn. He waspale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and asecond later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\"\\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next\\nto him.98\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry\\nas \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolledup her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how\\nhungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students,\\nhis arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than tosee them all there.\\n\"Welcome,\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin\\nour banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!\\nBlubber! Oddment! Tweak!\\n\"Thank you!\"He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\\'t know\\nwhether to laugh or not.\\n\"Is he -- a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly.\\n\"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He\\'s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But\\nhe is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\"\\nHarry\\'s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with\\nfood. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table:\\nroast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, baconand steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding,peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, pepperminthumbugs.\\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\\'d never been\\nallowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anythingthat Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled hisplate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.It was all delicious.\\n\"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry\\ncut up his steak,\\n\"Can\\'t you --?\"99I haven\\'t eaten for nearly four hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don\\'t\\nneed to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\\'t think I\\'ve in troducedmyself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghostof Gryffindor Tower.\"\\n\"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you\\n-- you\\'re Nearly Headless Nick!\"\\n\"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --\" the ghost began\\nstiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\\n\"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\"\\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\\'t\\ngoing at all the way he wanted.\\n\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His\\nwhole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was ona hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it\\nproperly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly\\nHeadless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,\"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you\\'re going to help us win the housechampionship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long withoutwinning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The BloodyBaron\\'s becoming almost unbearable -- he\\'s the Slytherin ghost.\"\\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost\\nsitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stainedwith silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased tosee, didn\\'t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\\n\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest.\\n\"I\\'ve never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food\\nfaded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A momentlater the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor youcould think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam\\ndoughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- \"\\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their\\nfamilies.100\"I\\'m half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad\\'s a Muggle. Mom didn\\'t tell\\nhim she was a witch \\'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shockfor him.\"\\nThe others laughed.\\n\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.\\n\"Well, my gran brought me up and she\\'s a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the\\nfamily thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kepttrying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- hepushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but\\nnothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for\\ndinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankleswhen my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally letgo. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. Theywere all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And youshould have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might\\nnot be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased\\nhe bought me my toad.\"\\nOn Harry\\'s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about\\nlessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there\\'s so much to learn, I\\'mparticularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning somethinginto something else, of course, it\\'s supposed to be very difficult-\";\\n\"You\\'ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of\\nthing -- \").\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up atthe High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.\\nProfessor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor\\nQuirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasyblack hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\\'s\\nturban straight into Harry\\'s eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot acrossthe scar on Harry\\'s forehead.\\n\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n\"What is it?\" asked Percy.101\"N-nothing.\"\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the\\nfeeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\\'s look -- a feeling that hedidn\\'t like Harry at all.\\n\"Who\\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy.\\n\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\\'s looking so\\nnervous, that\\'s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\\'t wantto -- everyone knows he\\'s after Quirrell\\'s job. Knows an awful lot aboutthe Dark Arts, Snape.\"\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\\'t look at him again.\\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to\\nhis feet again. The hall fell silent.\\n\"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I\\nhave a few start-of-term notices to give you.\\n\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to\\nall pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to rememberthat as well.\"\\nDumbledore\\'s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley\\ntwins.\\n\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all\\nthat no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\\n\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone\\ninterested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\\n\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor\\non the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish todie a very painful death.\"\\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\\n\"He\\'s not serious?\" he muttered to Percy.102\"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It\\'s odd, because he\\nusually gives us a reason why we\\'re not allowed to go somewhere -- theforest\\'s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think hemight have told us prefects, at least.\"\\n\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried\\nDumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\\' smiles had become\\nrather fixed.\\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a\\nfly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rosehigh above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\n\"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\"\\nAnd the school bellowed:\\n\"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,Teach us something please,\\nWhether we be old and bald\\nOr young with scabby knees,Our heads could do with filling\\nWith some interesting stuff,\\nFor now they\\'re bare and full of air,Dead flies and bits of fluff,\\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\\nBring back what we\\'ve forgot,just do your best, we\\'ll do the rest,And learn until our brains all rot.\\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the\\nWeasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they103had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\\n\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here!\\nAnd now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"\\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds,\\nout of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\\'s legs were\\nlike lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. Hewas too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraitsalong the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twicePercy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hangingtapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging theirfeet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when\\nthey came to a sudden halt.\\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as\\nPercy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\\n\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised\\nhis voice, \"Peeves -- show yourself\"\\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide\\nmouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking\\nsticks.\\n\"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\"He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\\n\"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\\'ll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked\\nPercy.\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on\\nNeville\\'s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor ashe passed.\\n\"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again.\\n\"The Bloody Baron\\'s the only one who can control him, he won\\'t evenlisten to us prefects. Here we are.\"104At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a\\npink silk dress.\\n\"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait\\nswung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled\\nthrough it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the\\nGryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the\\nboys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they wereobviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: fivefour-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had\\nalready been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their\\npajamas and fell into bed.\\n\" Great food, isn\\'t it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.\\n\"Get off, Scabbers! He\\'s chewing my sheets.\"\\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he\\'d had any of the treacle tart, but he\\nfell asleep almost at once.\\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange\\ndream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\\'s turban, which kept talking tohim, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it washis destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\\'t want to be in Slytherin; it\\ngot heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened\\npainfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled withit -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laughbecame high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke,sweating and shaking.\\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he\\ndidn\\'t remember the dream at all.\\nCHAPTER EIGHT\\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\\nThere, look.\"\\n\"Where?\"105\"Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\"\\n\"Wearing the glasses?\"\"Did you see his face?\"\\n\"Did you see his scar?\"\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next\\nday. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a lookat him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.Harry wished they wouldn\\'t, because he was trying to concentrate on\\nfinding his way to classes.\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,\\nsweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere differenton a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had toremember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\\'t open unless you\\nasked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors\\nthat weren\\'t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. Itwas also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemedto move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visiteach other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\\nThe ghosts didn\\'t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of\\nthem glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly\\nHeadless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the rightdirection, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and atrick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He woulddrop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet,pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab\\nyour nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\"\\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus\\nFilch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on theirvery first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through adoor that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-boundscorridor on the third floor. He wouldn\\'t believe they were lost, was\\nsure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening\\nto lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by ProfessorQuirrell, who was passing.106Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature\\nwith bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\\'s. She patrolled thecorridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out ofline, and she\\'d whisk off for Filch, who\\'d appear, wheezing, two secondslater. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better thananyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly\\nas any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest\\nambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes\\nthemselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out,than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\\nWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and themovements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to thegreenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy littlewitch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care ofall the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.\\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only\\none taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old\\nindeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got\\nup next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned onand on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the\\nEvil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had\\nto stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of theirfirst class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\\'s name hegave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to\\nthink she wasn\\'t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them atalking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.\\n\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you\\nwill learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class\\nwill leave and not come back. You have been warned.\"\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very\\nimpressed and couldn\\'t wait to get started, but soon realized they107weren\\'t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.\\nAfter taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a matchand started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson,only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; ProfessorMcGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy andgave Hermione a rare smile.\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\\'s lessons turned out to be a bit ofa joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone saidwas to ward off a vampire he\\'d met in Romania and was afraid would becoming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, hadbeen given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of\\na troublesome zombie, but they weren\\'t sure they believed this story.\\nFor one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrellhad fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking aboutthe weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hungaround the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffedfull of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\\'t miles behind everyone\\nelse. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\\'thad any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much tolearn that even people like Ron didn\\'t have much of a head start.\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to\\nfind their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost\\nonce.\\n\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his\\nporridge.\\n\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape\\'s Head of\\nSlytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we\\'ll be able to seeif it\\'s true.\"\\n\"Wish McGonagall favored us, \" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head\\nof Gryffindor House, but it hadn\\'t stopped her from giving them a hugepile of homework the day before.\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but\\nit had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about ahundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,108circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters\\nand packages onto their laps.\\nHedwig hadn\\'t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to\\nnibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in theowlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered\\ndown between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto\\nHarry\\'s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidyscrawl:\\nDear Harry,\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have\\na cup of tea with me around three?\\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with\\nHedwig.\\nHagrid\\nHarry borrowed Ron\\'s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the\\nback of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because\\nthe Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to\\nhim so far.\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor\\nSnape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\\'dbeen wrong. Snape didn\\'t dislike Harry -- he hated him.\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder\\nhere than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enoughwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and\\nlike Flitwick, he paused at Harry\\'s name.\\n\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.\"\\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their109hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His\\neyes were black like Hagrid\\'s, but they had none of Hagrid\\'s warmth.They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\\n\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of\\npotionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but\\nthey caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught\\nevery word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping aclass silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-wavinghere, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\\'t expect youwill really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron withits shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep throughhuman veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach\\nyou how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren\\'t\\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"\\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks\\nwith raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat andlooked desperate to start proving that she wasn\\'t a dunderhead.\\n\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered\\nroot of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"\\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who\\nlooked as stumped as he was; Hermione\\'s hand had shot into the air.\\n\"I don\\'t know, sit,\" said Harry.\\nSnape\\'s lips curled into a sneer.\"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn\\'t everything.\"\\nHe ignored Hermione\\'s hand.\\n\"Let\\'s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me\\na bezoar?\"\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without\\nher leaving her seat, but Harry didn\\'t have the faintest idea what a\\nbezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were\\nshaking with laughter.\\n\"I don\\'t know, sit.\" \"Thought you wouldn\\'t open a book before coming,110eh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those\\ncold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\\', but didSnape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbsand Fungi?\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione\\'s quivering hand.\\n\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\\nceiling.\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why\\ndon\\'t you try her?\"\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\\'s eye, and Seamus winked.\\nSnape, however, was not pleased.\\n\"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter,\\nasphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as\\nthe Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomachof a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood andwolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name ofaconite. Well? Why aren\\'t you all copying that down?\"\\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise,\\nSnape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your\\ncheek, Potter.\"\\nThings didn\\'t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson\\ncontinued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up asimple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,\\nwatching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing\\nalmost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was justtelling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his hornedslugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled thedungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\\'s cauldron into atwisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor,burning holes in people\\'s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was\\nstanding on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the\\npotion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boilssprang up all over his arms and legs.111\"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one\\nwave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills beforetaking the cauldron off the fire?\"\\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\\n\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he\\nrounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\n\"You -- Potter -- why didn\\'t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought\\nhe\\'d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\\'s anotherpoint you\\'ve lost for Gryffindor.\"\\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked\\nhim behind their cauldron.\\n\"Doi* push it,\" he muttered, \"I\\'ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\"As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\'s mind\\nwas racing and his spirits were low. He\\'d lost two points for Gryffindor\\nin his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\"said Ron, \"Snape\\'s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I comeand meet Hagrid with you?\"\\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the\\ngrounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the\\nforbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the\\nfront door.\\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and\\nseveral booming barks. Then Hagrid\\'s voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang-- back.\"\\nHagrid\\'s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door\\nopen.\\n\"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\"He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous\\nblack boarhound.\\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the\\nceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner112stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\\n\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded\\nstraight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang wasclearly not as fierce as he looked.\\n\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a\\nlarge teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\\n\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\\'s freckles. I spent\\nhalf me life chasin\\' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"\\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their\\nteeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told\\nHagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\\'sknee and drooled all over his robes.\\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \"that old git.\"\\n\"An\\' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\\'d like ter introduce her to Fang\\nsometime. D\\'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows meeverywhere? Can\\'t get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\"\\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape\\'s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not\\nto worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n\"But he seemed to really hate me.\"\\n\"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\"Yet Harry couldn\\'t help thinking that Hagrid didn\\'t quite meet his eyes\\nwhen he said that.\\n\"How\\'s yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot --\\ngreat with animals.\"\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron\\ntold Hagrid all about Charlie\\'s work with dragons, Harry picked up apiece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a\\ncutting from the Daily Prophet:\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST113Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July,\\nwidely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault\\nthat was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\\n\"But we\\'re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if\\nyou know what\\'s good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin thisafternoon.\\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to\\nrob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\\'t mentioned the date.\\n\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!\\nIt might\\'ve been happening while we were there!\"\\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\\'t meet Harry\\'s eyes\\nthis time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read thestory again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied\\nearlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and\\nthirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby littlepackage. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets\\nweighed down with rock cakes they\\'d been too polite to refuse, Harrythought that none of the lessons he\\'d had so far had given him as much\\nto think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package\\njust in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something aboutSnape that he didn\\'t want to tell Harry?\\nCHAPTER NINE\\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley,\\nbut that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-yearGryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\\'t have toput up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\\'t until they spotted a\\nnotice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.\\nFlying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor andSlytherin would be learning together.114\"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool\\nof myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\"\\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\"You don\\'t know that you\\'ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron\\nreasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy\\'s always going on about how good he\\nis at Quidditch, but I bet that\\'s all talk.\"\\nMalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about\\nfirst years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long,boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escapingMuggles in helicopters. He wasn\\'t the only one, though: the way Seamus\\nFinnigan told it, he\\'d spent most of his childhood zooming around the\\ncountryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\\'d listenabout the time he\\'d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\\'s old broom.Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ronhad already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared theirdormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\\'t see what was exciting about a game\\nwith only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron\\nprodding Dean\\'s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make theplayers move.\\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his\\ngrandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\\'d hadgood reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of\\naccidents even with both feet on the ground.\\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This\\nwas something you couldn\\'t learn by heart out of a book -- not that shehadn\\'t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid withflying tips she\\'d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through\\nthe Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for\\nanything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, buteverybody else was very pleased when Hermione\\'s lecture was interruptedby the arrival of the mail.\\nHarry hadn\\'t had a single letter since Hagrid\\'s note, something that\\nMalfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\\'s eagle owl was\\nalways bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened\\ngloatingly at the Slytherin table.\\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He115opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large\\nmarble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\\n\"It\\'s a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things -- this\\ntells you if there\\'s something you\\'ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold ittight like this and if it turns red -- oh...\" His face fell, because the\\nRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,\\n\"You\\'ve forgotten something...\"Neville was trying to remember what he\\'d forgotten when Draco Malfoy,\\nwho was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of hishand.\\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason\\nto fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot troublequicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\\n\"What\\'s going on?\"\\n\"Malfoy\\'s got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind\\nhim.\\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors\\nhurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flyinglesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under theirfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawnon the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees\\nwere swaying darkly in the distance.\\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying\\nin neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasleycomplain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started tovibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and\\nyellow eyes like a hawk.\\n\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a116broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck\\nout at odd angles.\\n\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the\\nfront, \"and say \\'Up!\"\\'\\n\"UPF everyone shouted.Harry\\'s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few\\nthat did. Hermione Granger\\'s had simply rolled over on the ground, andNeville\\'s hadn\\'t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell\\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\\'s\\nvoice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on theground.\\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding\\noff the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\\'d been doing it\\nwrong for years.\\n\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said\\nMadam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then comestraight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three-- two --\"\\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\\nground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\\'slips.\\n\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a\\ncork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his\\nscared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,slip sideways off the broom and --\\nWHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass\\nin a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, andstarted to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\\n\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy -- it\\'s all right,117up you get.\".\\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You\\nleave those brooms where they are or you\\'ll be out of Hogwarts before\\nyou can say \\'Quidditch.\\' Come on, dear.\"\\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with\\nMadam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\\n\"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"\\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.\\n\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced\\nSlytherin girl. \"Never thought you\\'d like fat little crybabies,Parvati.\"\\n\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the\\ngrass. \"It\\'s that stupid thing Longbottom\\'s gran sent him.\"\\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\\n\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking\\nto watch.\\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\\n\"I think I\\'ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about --\\nup a tree?\"\\n\"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick\\nand taken off. He hadn\\'t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering levelwith the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it,\\nPotter!\"\\nHarry grabbed his broom.118\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move --\\nyou\\'ll get us all into trouble.\"\\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom\\nand kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushedthrough his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of\\nfierce joy he realized he\\'d found something he could do without being\\ntaught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick upa little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girlsback on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked\\nstunned.\\n\"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I\\'ll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh,\\nyeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom\\ntightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy\\nonly just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and\\nheld the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\\n\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\\n\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball\\nhigh into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and\\nthen start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down-- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\\n-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people\\nwatching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground hecaught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppledgently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\\n\"HARRY POTTER!\"\\nHis heart sank faster than he\\'d just dived. Professor McGonagall was\\nrunning toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\\n\"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --\"119Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses\\nflashed furiously, \"-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --\"\\n\"It wasn\\'t his fault, Professor --\"\\n\"Be quiet, Miss Patil\\n\"But Malfoy --\"\"That\\'s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\"Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\\'s triumphant faces as he\\nleft, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\\'s wake as she strode toward\\nthe castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted tosay something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrongwith his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without evenlooking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\\'d done it. He hadn\\'teven lasted two weeks. He\\'d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What\\nwould the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor\\nMcGonagall didn\\'t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marchedalong corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she wastaking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed tostay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\\'s assistant. His\\nstomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming\\nwizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\\'s bag.\\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door\\nand poked her head inside.\\n\"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\"\\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on\\nhim?\\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out\\nof Flitwicles class looking confused.\\n\"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up\\nthe corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.120\"In here.\"\\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except\\nfor Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\\n\"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which\\nclanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed\\nthe door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\\n\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I\\'ve found you a Seeker.\"Wood\\'s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\\n\"Are you serious, Professor?\"\\n\"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy\\'s a natural.\\nI\\'ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on abroomstick, Potter?\"\\nHarry nodded silently. He didn\\'t have a clue what was going on, but he\\ndidn\\'t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started comingback to his legs.\\n\"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor\\nMcGonagall told Wood. \"Didn\\'t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasleycouldn\\'t have done it.\"\\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\\n\"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly.\"Wood\\'s captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained.\\n\"He\\'s just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around\\nHarry and staring at him. \"Light -- speedy -- we\\'ll have to get him adecent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven,I\\'d say.\"\\nI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\\'t bend the\\nfirst-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.\\nFlattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\\'t look Severus Snapein the face for weeks....\"121Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\\n\"I want to hear you\\'re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind\\nabout punishing you.\"\\nThen she suddenly smiled.\\n\"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent\\nQuidditch player himself.\"\\n\"You\\'re joking.\"It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened\\nwhen he\\'d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of\\nsteak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\\'d forgotten all aboutit.\\n\"Seeker?\" he said. \"But first years never -- you must be the youngest\\nhouse player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his\\nmouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the\\nafternoon. \"Wood told me.\"\\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\"I start training next week,\" said Harry. \"Only don\\'t tell anyone, Wood\\nwants to keep it a secret.\"\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and\\nhurried over.\\n\"Well done,\" said George in a low voice. \"Wood told us. We\\'re on the\\nteam too -- Beaters.\"\\n\"I tell you, we\\'re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\"\\nsaid Fred. \"We haven\\'t won since Charlie left, but this year\\'s team isgoing to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skippingwhen he told us.\"\\n\"Anyway, we\\'ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\\'s found a new secret\\npassageway out of the school.\"\\n\"Bet it\\'s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found\\nin our first week. See you.\"122Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome\\nturned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\n\"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the\\nMuggles?\"\\n\"You\\'re a lot braver now that you\\'re back on the ground and you\\'ve got\\nyour little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly. There was of coursenothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table wasfull of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack theirknuckles and scowl.\\n\"I\\'d take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy. \"Tonight, if you want.\\nWizard\\'s duel. Wands only -- no contact. What\\'s the matter? Never heardof a wizard\\'s duel before, I suppose?\"\\n\"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around. \"I\\'m his second, who\\'s\\nyours?\"\\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\\n\"Crabbe,\" he said. \"Midnight all right? We\\'ll meet you in the trophy\\nroom; that\\'s always unlocked.\"\\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \"What is a\\nwizard\\'s duel?\" said Harry. \"And what do you mean, you\\'re my second?\"\\n\"Well, a second\\'s there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually,\\ngetting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\\'sface, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know,with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\\'ll be able to do is send\\nsparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real\\ndamage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\"\\n\"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\"\"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested. \"Excuse me.\"\\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\n\"Can\\'t a person eat in peace in this place?\" said Ron.123Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\\n\"I couldn\\'t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --\"\"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered.\\n\"--and you mustn\\'t go wandering around the school at night, think of the\\npoints you\\'ll lose Gryffindor if you\\'re caught, and you\\'re bound to be.It\\'s really very selfish of you.\"\\n\"And it\\'s really none of your business,\" said Harry.\"Good-bye,\" said Ron.\\nAll the same, it wasn\\'t what you\\'d call the perfect end to the day,\\nHarry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamusfalling asleep (Neville wasn\\'t back from the hospital wing). Ron hadspent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you,you\\'d better dodge it, because I can\\'t remember how to block them.\"\\nThere was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or\\nMrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking anotherschool rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept loomingup out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoyface-to-face. He couldn\\'t miss it.\\n\"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we\\'d better go.\"\\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across\\nthe tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindorcommon room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turningall the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reachedthe portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I\\ncan\\'t believe you\\'re going to do this, Harry.\"\\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe\\nand a frown.\\n\"You!\" said Ron furiously. \"Go back to bed!\"\\n\"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy -- he\\'s a\\nprefect, he\\'d put a stop to this.\"\\nHarry couldn\\'t believe anyone could be so interfering.124\"Come on,\" he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady\\nand climbed through the hole.\\nHermione wasn\\'t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through\\nthe portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\\n\"Don\\'t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I\\ndon\\'t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\\'ll lose all thepoints I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about SwitchingSpells.\"\\n\"Go away.\" \"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said\\nwhen you\\'re on the train home tomorrow, you\\'re so --\"\\nBut what they were, they didn\\'t find out. Hermione had turned to the\\nportrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing anempty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermionewas locked out of Gryffindor tower.\\n\"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly.\\n\"That\\'s your problem,\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve got to go, we 3 re going to be\\nlate.\"\\nThey hadn\\'t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up\\nwith them.\\n\"I\\'m coming with you,\" she said.\"You are not.\"\\n\"D\\'you think I\\'m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?\\nIf he finds all three of us I\\'ll tell him the truth, that I was tryingto stop you, and you can back me up.\"\\n\"You\\'ve got some nerve --\" said Ron loudly.\"Shut up, both of you!\" said Harry sharply. I heard something.\"\\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\\n\"Mrs. Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.125It wasn\\'t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor,\\nfast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\\n\"Thank goodness you found me! I\\'ve been out here for hours, I couldn\\'t\\nremember the new password to get in to bed.\"\\n\"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password\\'s \\'Pig snout\\' but it won\\'t\\nhelp you now, the Fat Lady\\'s gone off somewhere.\"\\n\"How\\'s your arm?\" said Harry.\"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a\\nminute.\"\\n\"Good - well, look, Neville, we\\'ve got to be somewhere, we\\'ll see you\\nlater --\"\\n\"Don\\'t leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don\\'t want to\\nstay here alone, the Bloody Baron\\'s been past twice already.\"\\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and\\nNeville.\\n\"If either of you get us caught, I\\'ll never rest until I\\'ve learned that\\nCurse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the\\nCurse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckonedthem all forward.\\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the\\nhigh windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.\\nNorris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floorand tiptoed toward the trophy room.\\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren\\'t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered\\nwhere the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statueswinked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls,\\nkeeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took\\nout his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutescrept by.126\"He\\'s late, maybe he\\'s chickened out,\" Ron whispered.\\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised\\nhis wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn\\'t Malfoy.\\n\"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\"\\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly\\nat the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurriedsilently toward the door, away from Filch\\'s voice. Neville\\'s robes hadbarely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophyroom.\\n\"They\\'re in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\"\\n\"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to\\ncreep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filchgetting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and brokeinto a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of\\nthem toppled right into a suit of armor.\\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\\nlooking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around thedoorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead,\\nwithout any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped\\nthrough a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtledalong it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew wasmiles from the trophy room.\\n\"I think we\\'ve lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall\\nand wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and\\nspluttering.\\nI -- told -you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,\\n\"I -- told -- you.\"\\n\"We\\'ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as\\npossible.\"\\n\"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don\\'t\\nyou? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to127be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\"\\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\\'t going to tell her\\nthat.\\n\"Let\\'s go.\"\\nIt wasn\\'t going to be that simple. They hadn\\'t gone more than a dozen\\npaces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of aclassroom in front of them.\\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\\n\"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you\\'ll get us thrown out.\"\\nPeeves cackled.\"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,\\nnaughty, you\\'ll get caughty.\"\\n\"Not if you don\\'t give us away, Peeves, please.\"\\n\"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his\\neyes glittered wickedly. \"It\\'s for your own good, you know.\"\\n\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a\\nbig mistake.\\n\"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED\\nDOWN THECHARMS CORRIDOR\"\\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the\\ncorridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.\\n\"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We\\'re\\ndone for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running asfast as he could toward Peeves\\'s shouts.\\n\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\\'s wand, tapped the\\nlock, and whispered, \\'Alohomora!\"\\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut128it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\\n\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\"\"Say \\'please.\"\\'\\n\"Don\\'t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\"\\n\"Shan\\'t say nothing if you don\\'t say please,\" said Peeves in his\\nannoying singsong voice.\\n\"All right -please.\"\\n\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\\'t say nothing if you didn\\'t say\\nplease! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshingaway and Filch cursing in rage.\\n\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we\\'ll be okay\\n-- get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of\\nHarry\\'s bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\"\\nHarry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he\\nwas sure he\\'d walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top ofeverything that had happened so far.\\nThey weren\\'t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The\\nforbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was\\nforbidden.\\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that\\nfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads.Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching\\nand quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging\\nin slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry\\nknew that the only reason they weren\\'t already dead was that theirsudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting\\nover that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\\nHarry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he\\'d take\\nFilch.129They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they\\nalmost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to lookfor them somewhere else, because they didn\\'t see him anywhere, but theyhardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possiblebetween them and that monster. They didn\\'t stop running until they\\nreached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\\n\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their\\nbathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\\n\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the\\nportrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and\\ncollapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked\\nas if he\\'d never speak again.\\n\"What do they think they\\'re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up\\nin a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one\\ndoes.\"\\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You\\ndon\\'t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn\\'t you seewhat it was standing on.\\n\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn\\'t looking at its feet, I was too\\nbusy with its heads.\"\\n\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\\'s obviously\\nguarding something.\"\\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\\nI hope you\\'re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed --\\nor worse, expelled. Now, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m going to bed.\"\\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\\n\"No, we don\\'t mind,\" he said. \"You\\'d think we dragged her along,\\nwouldn\\'t you.\\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed130back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said?\\nGringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted tohide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.\\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package\\nfrom vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\nCHAPTER TEN\\nHALLOWEENMalfoy couldn\\'t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were\\nstill at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.\\nIndeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting thethree-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quitekeen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about thepackage that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, andthey spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy\\nprotection. \"It\\'s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.\\n\"Or both,\" said Harry.\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it\\nwas about two inches long, they didn\\'t have much chance of guessing whatit was without further clues.\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\\nunderneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was nevergoing near the dog again.\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a\\nbossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really\\nwanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their greatdelight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\\'s attention\\nwas caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screechowls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in\\nthis large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped\\nit right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They hadhardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on topof the parcel.131Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\\'t want everybody\\nknowing you\\'ve got a broomstick or they\\'ll all want one. Oliver Woodwill meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\\'clock for yourfirst training session.\\nProfessor McGonagall\\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to\\nread.\\n\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I\\'ve never even touched\\none.\"\\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private\\nbefore their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall theyfound the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized thepackage from Harry and felt it.\\n\"That\\'s a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\\nof jealousy and spite on his face. \"You\\'ll be in for it this time,\\nPotter, first years aren\\'t allowed them.\"\\nRon couldn\\'t resist it.\"It\\'s not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it\\'s a Nimbus Two Thousand.\\nWhat did you say you\\'ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron\\ngrinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they\\'re not in the same\\nleague as the Nimbus.\"\\n\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\\'t afford half the\\nhandle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have tosave up twig by twig.\"\\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\\'s elbow.\\n\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.132\"Potter\\'s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.\\n\"Yes, yes, that\\'s right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.\\n\"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances,Potter. And what model is it?\"\\n\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the\\nlook of horror on Malfoy\\'s face. \"And it\\'s really thanks to Malfoy herethat I\\'ve got it,\" he added.\\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\\'s\\nobvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it\\'s true,\" Harry chortled as theyreached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn\\'t stolen Neville\\'s\\nRemembrall I wouln\\'t be on the team....\"\\n\"So I suppose you think that\\'s a reward for breaking rules?\" came an\\nangry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\\'s hand.\\n\"I thought you weren\\'t speaking to us?\" said Harry.\\n\"Yes, don\\'t stop now,\" said Ron, \"it\\'s doing us so much good.\"Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It\\nkept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying\\nunder his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\\'d belearning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening withoutnoticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrapthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\'s bedspread.\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\\nlooked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a longtail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in goldnear the top.\\nAs seven o\\'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the\\ndusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadiumbefore. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so thatthe spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end133of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They\\nreminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle\\nchildren blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\\nand kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out\\nof the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus TwoThousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\\n\"Hey, Potter, come down!\\'Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his\\narm. Harry landed next to him.\\n\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall\\nmeant... you really are a natural. I\\'m just going to teach you the rulesthis evening, then you\\'ll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\\n\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\\nif it\\'s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.Three of them are called Chasers.\"\\n\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\\nabout the size of a soccer ball.\\n\"This ball\\'s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the\\nQuaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops toscore a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of thehoops. Follow me?\"\\n\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\"\\nHarry recited. \"So -- that\\'s sort of like basketball on broomsticks withsix hoops, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"What\\'s basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry\\nquickly.\\n\"Now, there\\'s another player on each side who\\'s called the Keeper -I\\'m\\nKeeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the otherteam from scoring.\"134\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember\\nit all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what arethey for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\n\"I\\'ll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"\\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\\n\"I\\'m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are\\nthe Bludgers.\"\\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\\nthe red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to\\nescape the straps holding them inside the box.\\n\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\\nBludgers.\\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\\nHarry\\'s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breakinghis nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed aroundtheir heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed topin it to the ground.\\n\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\\nand strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to\\nknock players off their brooms. That\\'s why you have two Beaters on eachteam -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it\\'s their job to protect theirside from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So-- think you\\'ve got all that?\"\\n\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\\ngoal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harryreeled off.\\n\"Very good,\" said Wood.\"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he\\nsounded offhand.\\n\"Never at Hogwarts. We\\'ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse\\nthan that. Now, the last member of the team is the135Seeker. That\\'s you. And you don\\'t have to worry about the Quaffle or the\\nBludgers unless they crack my head open.\"\\n\"Don\\'t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I\\nmean, they\\'re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"\\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\\nCompared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the sizeof a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silverwings.\\n\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it\\'s the most important\\nball of the lot. It\\'s very hard to catch because it\\'s so fast and\\ndifficult to see. It\\'s the Seeker\\'s job to catch it. You\\'ve got to weavein and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get itbefore the other team\\'s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches theSnitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they\\nnearly always win. That\\'s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of\\nQuidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages-- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing onsubstitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that\\'s it -- anyquestions?\"\\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\\ndoing it that was going to be the problem.\\n\"We won\\'t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting\\nit back inside the crate, \"it\\'s too dark, we might lose it. Let\\'s tryyou out with a few of these.\"\\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\\nminutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golfballs as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\\nHarry didn\\'t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\\nhour, night had really fallen and they couldn\\'t carry on.\\n\"That Quidditch cup\\'ll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily\\nas they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if youturn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played forEngland if he hadn\\'t gone off chasing dragons.\"136Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\\nthree evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardlybelieve it when he realized that he\\'d already been at Hogwarts twomonths. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. Hislessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had\\nmastered the basics.\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin\\nwafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announcedin Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,something they had all been dying to try since they\\'d seen him makeNeville\\'s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the\\nclass into pairs to practice. Harry\\'s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which\\nwas a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron,however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tellwhether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\\'t spoken toeither of them since the day Harry\\'s broomstick had arrived.\\n\"Now, don\\'t forget that nice wrist movement we\\'ve been practicing!\"\\nsqueaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books asusual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magicwords properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio,who said \\'s\\' instead of \\'f\\' and found himself on the floor with abuffalo on his chest.\"\\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\\nfeather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on thedesktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand andset fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.\\nRon, at the next table, wasn\\'t having much more luck.\\n\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.\\n\"You\\'re saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It\\'s Wing-gar-dium\\nLevi-o-sa, make the \\'gar\\' nice and long.\"\\n\"You do it, then, if you\\'re so clever,\" Ron snarled.\\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,\\n\"Wingardium Leviosa!\"137Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their\\nheads.\\n\"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here,\\nMiss Granger\\'s done it!\"\\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It\\'s no wonder no\\none can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into thecrowded corridor, \"she\\'s a nightmare, honestly. \"\\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.\\nHarry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she\\nwas in tears.\\n\"I think she heard you.\"\"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must\\'ve noticed\\nshe\\'s got no friends.\"\\nHermione didn\\'t turn up for the next class and wasn\\'t seen all\\nafternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast,Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender thatHermione was crying in the girls\\' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they hadentered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out\\nof their minds.\\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a\\nthousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making thecandles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on thegolden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.\\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\\ncame sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\'s chair, slumpedagainst the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought youought to know.\"\\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from\\nthe end of Professor Dumbledore\\'s wand to bring silence.138\"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories\\nimmediately!\"\\nPercy was in his element.\\n\"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if\\nyou follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first yearscoming through! Excuse me, I\\'m a prefect!\"\\n\"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\"Don\\'t ask me, they\\'re supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe\\nPeeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"\\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.\\nAs they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harrysuddenly grabbed Ron\\'s arm.\\n\"I\\'ve just thought -- Hermione.\"\\n\"What about her?\"\"She doesn\\'t know about the troll.\"Ron bit his lip.\\n\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy\\'d better not see us.\"\\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped\\ndown a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\\'bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick\\nfootsteps behind them.\\n\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the\\ncorridor and disappeared from view.\\n\"What\\'s he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn\\'t he down in the dungeons\\nwith the rest of the teachers?\"\\n\"Search me.\"139Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\\'s\\nfading footsteps.\\n\"He\\'s heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his\\nhand.\\n\"Can you smell something?\"\\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\\nsocks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\\nAnd then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of\\ngigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left,\\nsomething huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows andwatched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite\\ngray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head\\nperched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks\\nwith flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It washolding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because itsarms were so long.\\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its\\nlong ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\\n\"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\"\\n\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\\'t\\nabout to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the\\nkey, slam the door, and lock it.\\n\\'Yes!\"Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but\\nas they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts\\nstop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber\\nthey\\'d just chained up.\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.140\"It\\'s the girls\\' bathroom!\" Harry gasped.\\n\"Hermione!\" they said together.It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?\\nWheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key,\\nfumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if\\nshe was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking thesinks off the walls as it went.\\n\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he\\nthrew it as hard as he could against the wall.\\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking\\nstupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes sawHarry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it\\nwent.\\n\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he\\nthrew a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\\'t even seem to notice the pipehitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turningits ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\\n\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward\\nthe door, but she couldn\\'t move, she was still flat against the wall,her mouth open with terror.\\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It\\nroared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to\\nescape.\\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He\\ntook a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around thetroll\\'s neck from behind. The troll couldn\\'t feel Harry hanging there,but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up itsnose, and Harry\\'s wand had still been in his hand when he\\'d jumped -- it\\nhad gone straight up one of the troll\\'s nostrils.\\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry\\nclinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him141off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.\\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand --\\nnot knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spellthat came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll\\'s hand, rose high, high up into\\nthe air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, ontoits owner\\'s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on itsface, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was\\nstanding there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\\n\"Is it -- dead?\"I don\\'t think so,\" said Harry, I think it\\'s just been knocked out.\"\\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\\'s nose. It was covered\\nin what looked like lumpy gray glue.\\n\"Urgh -- troll boogers.\"He wiped it on the troll\\'s trousers.\\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.\\nThey hadn\\'t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\\'s roars. Amoment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room,closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell\\ntook one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly\\ndown on a toilet, clutching his heart.\\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and\\nHarry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\\'smind.\\n\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with\\ncold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing withhis wand in the air. \"You\\'re lucky you weren\\'t killed. Why aren\\'t you in142your dormitory?\"\\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He\\nwished Ron would put his wand down.\\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\\n\"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me.\"\\n\"Miss Granger!\"Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\\nI went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it\\non my own -- you know, because I\\'ve read all about them.\"\\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a\\nteacher? \"If they hadn\\'t found me, I\\'d be dead now. Harry stuck his wandup its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\\'t have\\ntime to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they\\narrived.\"\\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\\'t new to them.\"Well -- in that case...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the\\nthree of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of\\ntackling a mountain troll on your own?\"\\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last\\nperson to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretendingshe had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had startedhanding out sweets.\\n\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said\\nProfessor McGonagall. \"I\\'m very disappointed in you. If you\\'re not hurtat all, you\\'d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishingthe feast in their houses.\"\\nHermione left.\\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\\n\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have143taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five\\npoints. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\"\\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn\\'t speak at all until they had\\nclimbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of thetroll, quite apart from anything else.\\n\"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled.\\n\"Five, you mean, once she\\'s taken off Hermione\\'s.\"\"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind\\nyou, we did save her.\"\\n\"She might not have needed saving if we hadn\\'t locked the thing in with\\nher,\" Harry reminded him.\\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\\n\"Pig snout,\" they said and entered.\\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that\\nhad been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waitingfor them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them lookingat each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.\\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are\\nsome things you can\\'t share without ending up liking each other, andknocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\\nQUIDDITCH\\nAs they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains\\naround the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Everymorning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from theupstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled\\nup in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous\\nbeaverskin boots.\\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in144his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If\\nGryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the housechampionship.\\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as\\ntheir secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news\\nthat he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\\'t know\\nwhich was worse -- people telling him he\\'d be brilliant or peopletelling him they\\'d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn\\'t\\nknow how he\\'d have gotten through all his homework without her, whatwith all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She\\nhad also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a\\nvery interesting read.\\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cupmatch in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest\\nplayers, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to\\nthem; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees hadbeen known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry\\nand Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicerfor it. The day before Harry\\'s first Quidditch match the three of them\\nwere out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured\\nthem up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snapecrossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry,Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view;they were sure it wouldn\\'t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about\\ntheir guilty faces caught Snape\\'s eye. He limped over. He hadn\\'t seen\\nthe fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them offanyway.\\n\"What\\'s that you\\'ve got there, Potter?\"It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\\n\"Library books are not to be taken outside the school,\" said Snape.\\n\"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\"145\"He\\'s just made that rule up,\" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped\\naway. \"Wonder what\\'s wrong with his leg?\"\\n\"Dunno, but I hope it\\'s really hurting him,\" said Ron bitterly.The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and\\nRon\\'s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How willyou learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the rightanswers anyway.\\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take\\nhis mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of\\nSnape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if\\nhe could have it.\\n\"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that\\nSnape wouldn\\'t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer.\\nHe knocked again. Nothing.\\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed\\nthe door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes.\\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above\\nhis knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing\\nSnape bandages.\\n\"Blasted thing*,\" Snape was saying. \"How are you supposed to keep your\\neyes on all three heads at once?\"\\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but --\\n\"POTTER!\"Snape\\'s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to\\nhide his leg. Harry gulped.\\n\"I just wondered if I could have my book back.\"\\n\"GET OUT! OUT!\"146Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He\\nsprinted back upstairs.\\n\"Did you get it?\" Ron asked as Harry joined them. \"What\\'s the matter?\"In a low whisper, Harry told them what he\\'d seen.\\n\"You know what this means?\" he finished breathlessly. \"He tried to get\\npast that three-headed dog at Halloween! That\\'s where he was going whenwe saw him -- he\\'s after whatever it\\'s guarding! And Id bet mybroomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\"\\nHermione\\'s eyes were wide.\\n\"No -- he wouldn\\'t, she said. \"I know he\\'s not very nice, but he\\nwouldn\\'t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\"\\n\"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\"\\nsnapped Ron. \"I\\'m with Harry. I wouldn\\'t put anything past Snape. But\\nwhat\\'s he after? What\\'s that dog guarding?\"\\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville\\nwas snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\\'t sleep. He tried to empty his mind-- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in afew hours -- but the expression on Snape\\'s face when Harry had seen hisleg wasn\\'t easy to forget.\\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of\\nthe delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter ofeveryone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\\n\"You\\'ve got to eat some breakfast.\"\\n\"I don\\'t want anything.\"\\n\"Just a bit of toast,\" wheedled Hermione.\"I\\'m not hungry.\"\\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour\\'s time he\\'d be walking onto the field.\\n\"Harry, you need your strength,\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"Seekers are\\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\"147\"Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\\nsausages.\\nBy eleven o\\'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around\\nthe Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be\\nraised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going\\non sometimes.\\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in\\nthe top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner onone of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, andDean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion\\nunderneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that\\nthe paint flashed different colors.\\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were\\nchanging into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playingin green).\\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\\n\"Okay, men,\" he said.\"And women,\" said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\\n\"And women,\" Wood agreed. \"This is it.\"\\n\"The big one,\" said Fred Weasley.\"The one we\\'ve all been waiting for,\" said George.\\n\"We know Oliver\\'s speech by heart,\" Fred told Harry, \"we were on the\\nteam last year.\"\\n\"Shut up, you two,\" said Wood. \"This is the best team Gryffindor\\'s had\\nin years. We\\'re going to win. I know it.\"\\nHe glared at them all as if to say, \"Or else.\"\\n\"Right. It\\'s time. Good luck, all of you.\"\\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his148knees weren\\'t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting\\nfor the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\n\"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\" she said, once they were all\\ngathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking\\nparticularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harrythought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of thecorner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashingPotter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\\n\"Mount your brooms, please.\"\\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. \"And the\\nQuaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what\\nan excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --\"\\n\"JORDAN!\"\"Sorry, Professor.\"\\nThe Weasley twins\\' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the\\nmatch, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\\n\"And she\\'s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet,\\na good find of Oliver Wood\\'s, last year only a reserve -- back toJohnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin\\nCaptain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying\\nlike an eagle up there -- he\\'s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellentmove by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle --that\\'s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint,off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back ofthe head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that\\'sAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\\'s blocked by a\\nsecond Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\\'t tell\\nwhich -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back inpossession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she\\'sreally flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead149-- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses --\\nGRYFFINDORS SCORE!\"\\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the\\nSlytherins.\\n\"Budge up there, move along.\"\\n\"Hagrid!\"Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join\\nthem.\\n\"Bin watchin\\' from me hut,\" said Hagrid, patting a large pair of\\nbinoculars around his neck, \"But it isn\\'t the same as bein\\' in thecrowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\"\\n\"Nope,\" said Ron. \"Harry hasn\\'t had much to do yet.\"\\n\"Kept outta trouble, though, that\\'s somethin\\',\" said Hagrid, raising his\\nbinoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for\\nsome sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\\'s game plan.\\n\"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had\\nsaid. \"We don\\'t want you attacked before you have to be.\"\\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to\\nlet off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch.Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflectionfrom one of the Weasleys\\' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to\\ncome pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry\\ndodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\\n\"All right there, Harry?\" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger\\nfuriously toward Marcus Flint.\\n\"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks\\ntwo Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the --\\nwait a moment -- was that the Snitch?\"\\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too150busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his\\nleft ear.\\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the\\nstreak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neckand neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have\\nforgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to\\nwatch.\\nHarry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings\\nfluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --\\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint\\nhad blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\\'s broom spun off course, Harry\\nholding on for dear life.\\n\"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors.Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the\\ngoal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the\\nGolden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref! Red\\ncard!\"\\n\"What are you talking about, Dean?\" said Ron.\\n\"Red card!\" said Dean furiously. \"In soccer you get shown the red card\\nand you\\'re out of the game!\"\\n\"But this isn\\'t soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him.\\nHagrid, however, was on Dean\\'s side.\\n\"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the\\nair.\"\\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\n\"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating\\n\"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall.151\"I mean, after that open and revolting foul\\n\\'Jordan, I\\'m warning you --\"\"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which\\ncould happen to anyone, I\\'m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by\\nSpinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor\\nstill in possession.\"\\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously\\npast his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frighteninglurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He grippedthe broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\\'d never felt\\nanything like that.\\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him\\noff. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck theirriders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts-- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he\\nrealized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn\\'t\\nturn it. He couldn\\'t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through theair, and every now and then making violent swishing movements thatalmost unseated him.\\nLee was still commentating.\\n\"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet --\\npasses Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose-- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...\\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry\\'s\\nbroom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly higher, away\\nfrom the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\\n\"Dunno what Harry thinks he\\'s doing,\" Hagrid mumbled. He stared through\\nhis binoculars. \"If I didn\\' know better, I\\'d say he\\'d lost control ofhis broom... but he can\\'t have....\"\\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His\\nbroom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to\\nhold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\\'s broom had given a wildjerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding onwith only one hand.152\"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\" Seamus whispered.\\n\"Can\\'t have,\" Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \"Can\\'t nothing interfere\\nwith a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that toa Nimbus Two Thousand.\"\\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\\'s binoculars, but instead of\\nlooking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\\n\"What are you doing?\" moaned Ron, gray-faced.\"I knew it,\" Hermione gasped, \"Snape -- look.\"\\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands\\nopposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstopunder his breath.\\n\"He\\'s doing something -- jinxing the broom,\" said Hermione.\\n\"What should we do?\"\\n\"Leave it to me.\"Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned\\nthe binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was\\nalmost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on\\nits feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pullHarry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every timethey got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lowerand circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.Marcus\\nFlint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.\\n\"Come on, Hermione,\" Ron muttered desperately.Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and\\nwas now racing along the row behind him; she didn\\'t even stop to say\\nsorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.\\nReaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered afew, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto thehem of Snape\\'s robes.153It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.\\nA sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off himinto a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row --Snape would never know what had happened.\\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on\\nto his broom.\\n\"Neville, you can look!\" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into\\nHagrid\\'s jacket for the last five minutes.\\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his\\nhand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field\\non all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.\\n\"I\\'ve got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the\\ngame ended in complete confusion.\\n\"He didn\\'t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling\\ntwenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn\\'t brokenany rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results --Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harryheard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea backin Hagrid\\'s hut, with Ron and Hermione.\\n\"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He was\\ncursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\\'t take his eyes off you.\"\\n\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn\\'t heard a word of what had gone on next\\nto him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin\\' like that?\"\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell\\nhim. Harry decided on the truth.\\n\"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get past\\nthat three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was tryingto steal whatever it\\'s guarding.\"\\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\\n\"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said.154\"Fluffy?\"\\n\"Yeah -- he\\'s mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub\\nlas\\' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the\\n\"Yes?\" said Harry eagerly.\\n\"Now, don\\'t ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That\\'s top secret,\\nthat is.\"\\n\"But Snape\\'s trying to steal it.\"\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid again. \"Snape\\'s a Hogwarts teacher, he\\'d do\\nnothin\\' of the sort.\"\\n\"So why did he just try and kill Harry?\" cried Hermione.The afternoon\\'s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about\\nSnape.\\nI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\\'ve read all about them!\\nYou\\'ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\\'t blinking at all, I saw\\nhim!\"\\n\"I\\'m tellin\\' yeh, yer wrong!\" said Hagrid hotly. \"I don\\' know why\\nHarry\\'s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\\' try an\\' kill a student!\\nNow, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin\\' in things that don\\'concern yeh. It\\'s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\\' you forget whatit\\'s guardin\\', that\\'s between Professor Dumbledore an\\' Nicolas Flamel--\"\\n\"Aha!\" said Harry, \"so there\\'s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved,\\nis there?\"\\nHagrid looked furious with himself.\\nCHAPTER TWELVE\\nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED\\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find155itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the\\nWeasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so thatthey followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. Thefew owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky todeliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they couldfly off again.\\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common\\nroom and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors hadbecome icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.Worst of all were Professor Snape\\'s classes down in the dungeons, wheretheir breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close aspossible to their hot cauldrons.\\n\"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all\\nthose people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\\'renot wanted at home.\"\\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.\\nHarry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them.\\nMalfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditchmatch. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to geteveryone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacingHarry as Seeker next. Then he\\'d realized that nobody found this funny,because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stayon his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back\\nto taunting Harry about having no proper family.\\nIt was true that Harry wasn\\'t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.\\nProfessor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list ofstudents who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed upat once. He didn\\'t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be\\nthe best Christmas he\\'d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying,\\ntoo, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visitCharlie.\\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large\\nfir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out atthe bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\\n\"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the\\nbranches.156\"Nah, I\\'m all right, thanks, Ron.\"\\n\"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoys cold drawl from\\nbehind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hopingto be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hutof Hagrid\\'s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\\'s used\\nto.\"\\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\"WEASLEY!\"Ron let go of the front of Malfoy\\'s robes.\\n\"He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy\\nface out from behind the tree. \"Malfoy was insultin\\' his family.\"\\n\"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said\\nSnape silkily. \"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it\\nisn\\'t more. Move along, all of you.\"\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering\\nneedles everywhere and smirking.\\n\"I\\'ll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\\'s back, \"one of\\nthese days, I\\'ll get him --\"\\n\"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\"\\n\"Come on, cheer up, it\\'s nearly Christmas,\" said Hagrid. \"Tell yeh what,\\ncome with me an\\' see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\"\\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great\\nHall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy withthe Christmas decorations.\\n\"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?\"The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all\\naround the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood\\naround the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering withhundreds of candles.157\"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked.\\n\"Just one,\" said Hermione. \"And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we\\'ve got\\nhalf an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\"\\n\"Oh yeah, you\\'re right,\" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor\\nFlitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was\\ntrailing them over the branches of the new tree.\\n\"The library?\" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \"Just before\\nthe holidays? Bit keen, aren\\'t yeh?\"\\n\"Oh, we\\'re not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you\\nmentioned Nicolas Flamel we\\'ve been trying to find out who he is.\"\\n\"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here -- I\\'ve told yeh -- drop\\nit. It\\'s nothin\\' to you what that dog\\'s guardin\\'.\"\\n\"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\\'s all,\" said Hermione.\\n\"Unless you\\'d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We\\nmust\\'ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\\'t find himanywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I\\'ve read his name somewhere.\"\\n\"I\\'m sayin\\' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.\\n\"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left\\nHagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel\\'s name ever since Hagrid\\nhad let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snapewas trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to\\nbegin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a\\nbook. He wasn\\'t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or NotableMagical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important ModernMagical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. Andthen, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens ofthousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to\\nsearch while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling themoff the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the RestrictedSection. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\\'t somewhere in158there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the\\nteachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he\\'d neverget one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic nevertaught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advancedDefense Against the Dark Arts.\\n\"What are you looking for, boy?\"\\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry.Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\"You\\'d better get out, then. Go on -- out!\"\\nWishing he\\'d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left\\nthe library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\\'d better notask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\\'d beable to tell them, but they couldn\\'t risk Snape hearing what they wereup to.\\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\\nanything, but he wasn\\'t very hopeful. They had been looking for twoweeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons itwasn\\'t surprising they\\'d found nothing. What they really needed was anice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.\\nThey went off to lunch.\\n\"You will keep looking while I\\'m away, won\\'t you?\" said Hermione. \"And\\nsend me an owl if you find anything.\"\\n\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron.\\n\"It\\'d be safe to ask them.\"\\n\"Very safe, as they\\'re both dentists,\" said Hermione.Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time\\nto think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the\\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the\\ngood armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything theycould spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows-- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk159about even if they wouldn\\'t work.\\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\\nMuggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lotlike directing troops in battle. Ron\\'s set was very old and battered.Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in\\nhis family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen\\nweren\\'t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had troublegetting them to do what he wanted.\\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\\'t\\ntrust him at all. He wasn\\'t a very good player yet and they keptshouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don\\'t\\nsend me there, can\\'t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose\\nhim.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the nextday for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was asmall pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\\n\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\\npulled on his bathrobe.\\n\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I\\'ve got some presents!\"\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which\\nwas a lot bigger than Harry\\'s.\\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\\nscrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cutwooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it --it sounded a bit like an owl.\\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle\\nVernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.\\n\"That\\'s friendly,\" said Harry.\\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\\n\"Weird!\" he said, \\'NMat a shape! This is money?\"160\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid\\nand my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?\"\\n\"I think I know who that one\\'s from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and\\npointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn\\'t expectany presents and -- oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she\\'s made you a Weasley\\nsweater.\"\\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\\nemerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\\n\"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and\\nmine\\'s always maroon.\"\\n\"That\\'s really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was\\nvery tasty.\\nHis next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs\\nfrom Hermione.\\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very\\nlight. He unwrapped it.\\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it\\nlay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\\n\"I\\'ve heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\\nEvery Flavor Beans he\\'d gotten from Hermione. \"If that\\'s what I think itis -- they\\'re really rare, and really valuable.\"\\n\"What is it?\"\\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to\\nthe touch, like water woven into material.\\n\"It\\'s an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I\\'m\\nsure it is -- try it on.\"\\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\\n\"It is! Look down!\"\\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the161mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head\\nsuspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloakover his head and his reflection vanished completely.\\n\"There\\'s a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\"\\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow,\\nloopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Yourfather left this in my possession before he died. It is time it wasreturned to you. Use it well.\\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the\\ncloak.\\n\"I\\'d give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What\\'s the\\nmatter?\"\\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had\\nit really once belonged to his father?\\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung\\nopen and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloakquickly out of sight. He didn\\'t feel like sharing it with anyone else\\nyet.\\n\"Merry Christmas!\"\"Hey, look -- Harry\\'s got a Weasley sweater, too!\"\\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on\\nit, the other a G.\\n\"Harry\\'s is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry\\'s\\nsweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you\\'re not family.\"\\n\"Why aren\\'t you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it\\non, they\\'re lovely and warm.\"\\n\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.162\"You haven\\'t got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she\\nthinks you don\\'t forget your name. But we\\'re not stupid -- we know we\\'recalled Gred and Forge.\"\\n\"What\\'s all th is noise.\\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He\\nhad clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too,carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which\\nFred seized.\"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\\'re all wearing ours, even\\nHarry got one.\"\\n\"I -- don\\'t -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater\\nover his head, knocking his glasses askew.\\n\"And you\\'re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said\\nGeorge. \"Christmas is a time for family.\"\\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by\\nhis sweater.\\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred\\nfat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of\\nchipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravyand cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feetalong the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like thefeeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their littleplastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard\\ncracker with Fred and it didn\\'t just bang, it went off with a blast like\\na cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from theinside exploded a rear admiral\\'s hat and several live, white mice. Up atthe High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\\'s hat for aflowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwickhad just read him.\\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his\\nteeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagridgetting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\\'s163amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\\nthings out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminousballoons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were\\ngoing to end up as Mrs. Norris\\'s Christmas dinner.\\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball\\nfight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, theyreturned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke inhis new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected hewouldn\\'t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\\'t tried to help him so much.\\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,\\neveryone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit andwatch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower becausethey\\'d stolen his prefect badge.\\nIt had been Harry\\'s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been\\nnagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bedwas he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever hadsent it.\\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,\\nfell asleep almost as soon as he\\'d drawn the curtains of his\\nfour-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the\\ncloak out from under it.\\nHis father\\'s... this had been his father\\'s. He let the material flow\\nover his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the notehad said.\\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\\naround himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight andshadows. It was a very funny feeling.\\nUse it well.\\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him\\nin this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in thedark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filchwould never know.164Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back\\n-- his father\\'s cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- hewanted to use it alone.\\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\\nand climbed through the portrait hole.\\n\"Who\\'s there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked\\nquickly down the corridor.\\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then\\nit came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\\'d be able to\\nread as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.\\nHe set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as hewalked.\\nThe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his\\nway along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along\\nin midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the\\nsight gave him the creeps.\\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping\\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of thelibrary, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\\nThey didn\\'t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\\nwords in languages Harry couldn\\'t understand. Some had no title at all.One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. Thehairs on the back of Harry\\'s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it,maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books,as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\\'t be.\\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\\nhe looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A largeblack and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out withdifficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee,let it fall open.\\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was\\nscreaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, onehigh, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked overhis lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming165down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the\\nshelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\\'s pale, wildeyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch\\'soutstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\\'s shrieksstill ringing in his ears.\\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been\\nso busy getting away from the library, he hadn\\'t paid attention to wherehe was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\\'t recognize where hewas at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but hemust be five floors above there.\\n\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\\nwandering around at night, and somebody\\'s been in the library Restricted\\nSection.\"\\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must\\nknow a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, andto his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well,\\nthey can\\'t be far, we\\'ll catch them.\"\\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\\nahead. They couldn\\'t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridorand if they came much nearer they\\'d knock right into him -- the cloakdidn\\'t stop him from being solid.\\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It\\nwas his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, tryingnot to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the roomwithout their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harryleaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footstepsdying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before\\nhe noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs\\nwere piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaperbasket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something thatdidn\\'t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someonehad just put it there to keep it out of the way.\\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\\nframe, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carvedaround the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic166fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved\\nnearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflectionagain. He stepped in front of it.\\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He\\nwhirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the\\nbook had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but\\na whole crowd of people standing right behind him.\\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\\nthe mirror.\\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\\nreflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his\\nshoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror\\'strick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\\nreflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt\\nthe air behind him. If she was really there, he\\'d touch her, theirreflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and theothers existed only in the mirror.\\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her\\neyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the\\nglass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that\\nshe was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin,black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He woreglasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just asHarry\\'s did.\\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\\nthat of his reflection.\\n\"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\"They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the\\nfaces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green\\neyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as\\nthough he had Harry\\'s knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family,for the first time in his life.167The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\\nthem, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hopingto fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of acheinside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\\nHow long he stood there, he didn\\'t know. The reflections did not fade\\nand he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his\\nsenses. He couldn\\'t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. Hetore his eyes away from his mother\\'s face, whispered, \"I\\'ll come back,\"and hurried from the room.\\n\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly.\\n\"You can come tonight, I\\'m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\\n\"I\\'d like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly.\"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\'ll be able to\\nshow me your other brothers and everyone.\"\\n\"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house\\nthis summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about notfinding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\\'t youeating anything?\"\\nHarry couldn\\'t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them\\nagain tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\\'t seem very\\nimportant anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\\n\"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\"\\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror\\nroom again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk muchmore slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\\'s route from thelibrary, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\\n\"I\\'m freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let\\'s forget it and go back.\"\\n\"No!\" Harry hissed. I know it\\'s here somewhere.\"\\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction,\\nbut saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead168with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.\\n\"It\\'s here -- just here -- yes!\"They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his\\nshoulders and ran to the mirror.\\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\\n\"See?\" Harry whispered.\"I can\\'t see anything.\"\\n\"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them....\"\\n\"I can only see you.\"\"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\"\\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\\'t\\nsee his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\"Look at me!\" he said.\\n\"Can you see all your family standing around you?\"\\n\"No -- I\\'m alone -- but I\\'m different -- I look older -- and I\\'m head\\nboy!\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"I am -- I\\'m wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I\\'m holding the\\nhouse cup and the Quidditch cup -- I\\'m Quidditch captain, too.\\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at\\nHarry.\\n\"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\"\\n\"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --\"169\"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\"\\n\"You\\'re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\\'s interesting about that? I\\nwant to see my parents.\"\\n\"Don\\'t push me --\"\\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.\\nThey hadn\\'t realized how loudly they had been talking.\\n\"Quick!\"Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris\\ncame round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the\\nsame thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, sheturned and left.\\n\"This isn\\'t safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.\\nCome on.\"\\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\\nThe snow still hadn\\'t melted the next morning.\"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron.\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Why don\\'t we go down and visit Hagrid?\"\"No... you go...\"\\n\"I know what you\\'re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\\'t go back\\ntonight.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\"I dunno, I\\'ve just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you\\'ve had\\ntoo many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are\\nwandering around. So what if they can\\'t see you? What if they walk into\\nyou? What if you knock something over?\"\\n\"You sound like Hermione.\"170\"I\\'m serious, Harry, don\\'t go.\"\\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in\\nfront of the mirror, and Ron wasn\\'t going to stop him.\\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was\\nwalking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but hedidn\\'t meet anyone.\\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of\\nhis grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor infront of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all\\nnight with his family. Nothing at all.\\nExcept --\"So -- back again, Harry?\"\\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind\\nhim. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than AlbusDumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate toget to the mirror he hadn\\'t noticed him.\\n\" -- I didn\\'t see you, sir.\"\\n\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore,\\nand Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\\n\"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with\\nHarry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights ofthe Mirror of Erised.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t know it was called that, Sir.\"\\n\"But I expect you\\'ve realized by now what it does?\"\"It -- well -- it shows me my family --\"\\n\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\"\\n\"How did you know --?\"171\"I don\\'t need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently.\\n\"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\"\\nHarry shook his head.\"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the\\nMirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it\\nand see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\"\\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want...\\nwhatever we want...\"\\n\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less\\nthan the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have\\nnever known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley,who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standingalone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give usneither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced bywhat they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is\\nreal or even possible.\\n\"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you\\nnot to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you willnow be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,remember that. Now, why don\\'t you put that admirable cloak back on andget off to bed?\"\\nHarry stood up.\\n\"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\"\"Obviously, you\\'ve just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one\\nmore thing, however.\"\\n\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\"\"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\"Harry stared.\\n\"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas\\nhas come and gone and I didn\\'t get a single pair. People will insist ongiving me books.\"172It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore\\nmight not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shovedScabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\\nNICOLAS FLAMELDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of\\nErised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays theinvisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry\\nwished he could forget what he\\'d seen in the mirror as easily, but he\\ncouldn\\'t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamedabout his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a highvoice cackled with laughter.\\n\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said\\nRon, when Harry told him about these drearns.\\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different\\nview of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry beingout of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch hadcaught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn\\'t at least found out whoNicolas Flamel was.\\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary\\nbook, even though Harry was still sure he\\'d read the name somewhere.Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for tenminutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the othertwo, because Quidditch practice had started again.\\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that\\nhad replaced the snow couldn\\'t dampen his spirits. The Weasleyscomplained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\\'sside. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they wouldovertake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in sevenyears. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer\\nnightmares when he was tired out after training.\\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave\\nthe team a bit of bad news. He\\'d just gotten very angry with the173Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off\\ntheir brooms.\\n\"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That\\'s exactly the sort of\\nthing that\\'ll lose us the match! Snape\\'s refereeing this time, and he\\'llbe looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\"\\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\\n\"Snape\\'s refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When\\'s\\nhe ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\\'s not going to be fair if wemight overtake Slytherin.\"\\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\\n\"It\\'s not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We\\'ve just got to make sure we play a\\nclean game, so Snape hasn\\'t got an excuse to pick on us.\"\\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for\\nnot wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the\\nend of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor commonroom, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the onlything Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was verygood for her.\\n\"Don\\'t talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to\\nhim, \"I need to concen --\" He caught sight of Harry\\'s face. \"What\\'s thematter with you? You look terrible.\"\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other\\ntwo about Snape\\'s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\n\"Don\\'t play,\" said Hermione at once.\"Say you\\'re ill,\" said Ron.\"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested.\\n\"Really break your leg,\" said Ron.\\n\"I can\\'t,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\'t a reserve Seeker. If I back out,174Gryffindor can\\'t play at all.\"\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed\\nto climb through the portrait hole was anyone\\'s guess, because his legshad been stuck together with what they recognized at once as theLeg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to\\nGryffindor tower.\\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed\\nthe countercurse. Neville\\'s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet,trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sitwith Harry and Ron.\\n\"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said\\nhe\\'d been looking for someone to practice that on.\"\\n\"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report him!\"Neville shook his head.\\n\"I don\\'t want more trouble,\" he mumbled.\\n\"You\\'ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He\\'s used to\\nwalking all over people, but that\\'s no reason to lie down in front ofhim and make it easier.\"\\n\"There\\'s no need to tell me I\\'m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,\\nMalfoy\\'s already done that,\" Neville choked out.\\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog,\\nthe very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. Hegave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\\n\"You\\'re worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you\\nfor Gryffindor, didn\\'t it? And where\\'s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\"\\nNeville\\'s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\"Thanks, Harry... I think I\\'ll go to bed.... D\\'you want the card, you\\ncollect them, don\\'t you?\"\\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.175\"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever-\"\\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron\\nand Hermione.\\n\"I\\'ve found him!\" he whispered. \"I\\'ve found Flamel! I told you I\\'d read\\nthe name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen\\nto this: \\'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the darkwizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses ofdragon\\'s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, NicolasFlamel\\'!\"\\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\\'t looked so excited since they\\'d\\ngotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\\n\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\\'\\ndormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looksbefore she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\\n\"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this\\nout of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\"\\n\"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\\'d looked\\nsomething up, and started flicking frantically through the pages,muttering to herself.\\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\\n\"I knew it! I knew it!\"\"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.\\n\"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker\\nof the Sorcerer\\'s Stone!\"\\nThis didn\\'t have quite the effect she\\'d expected.\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron.\\n\"Oh, honestly, don\\'t you two read? Look -- read that, there.\"\\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient\\nstudy of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, a176legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform\\nany metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, whichwill make the drinker immortal.\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone over the centuries,\\nbut the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel,\\nthe noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six\\nhundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devonwith his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).\\n\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog must be\\nguarding Flamel\\'s Sorcerer\\'s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep itsafe for him, because they\\'re friends and he knew someone was after it,\\nthat\\'s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\"\\n\"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry. \"No\\nwonder Snape\\'s after it! Anyone would want it.\"\\n\"And no wonder we couldn\\'t find Flamel in that Study of Recent\\nDevelopments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He\\'s not exactly recent if he\\'s\\nsix hundred and sixty-five, is he?\"\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down\\ndifferent ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were stilldiscussing what they\\'d do with a Sorcerer\\'s Stone if they had one. Itwasn\\'t until Ron said he\\'d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry\\nremembered about Snape and the coming match.\\n\"I\\'m going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don\\'t, all the\\nSlytherins will think I\\'m just too scared to face Snape. I\\'ll showthem... it\\'ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\"\\n\"Just as long as we\\'re not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione.\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous,\\nwhatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\\'t too calm,either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship waswonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowedto, with such a biased referee?\\nHarry didn\\'t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to\\nkeep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wonderedwhether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions177lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so\\nhorrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\\'d found out about theSorcerer\\'s Stone? Harry didn\\'t see how he could -- yet he sometimes hadthe horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the\\nnext afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\\'d ever\\nsee him alive again. This wasn\\'t what you\\'d call comforting. Harryhardly heard a word of Wood\\'s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditchrobes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to\\nNeville, who couldn\\'t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or\\nwhy they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry\\nknow that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-LockerCurse. They\\'d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and wereready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n\"Now, don\\'t forget, it\\'s Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron\\nslipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n\"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don\\'t nag.\"Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\"Don\\'t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early\\ncapture of the Snitch it\\'s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor\\nHufflepuff too much.\"\\n\"The whole school\\'s out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the\\ndoor. \"Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore\\'s come to watch!\"\\nHarry\\'s heart did a somersault.\\n\"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.\\nThere was no mistaking that silver beard.\\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was\\nsimply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was\\nwatching.\\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched\\nonto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.178\"I\\'ve never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione. \"Look -they\\'re\\noff Ouch!\"\\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\\n\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn\\'t see you there.\"\\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\"Wonder how long Potter\\'s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone\\nwant a bet? What about you, Weasley?\"\\nRon didn\\'t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because\\nGeorge Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all herfingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who wascircling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\\n\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said\\nMalfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another\\npenalty for no reason at all. \"It\\'s people they feel sorry for. See,there\\'s Potter, who\\'s got no parents, then there\\'s the Weasleys, who\\'vegot no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\\'ve got nobrains.\"\\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\\n\"I\\'m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered.\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not\\ndaring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville.\"\\n\"Longbottom, if brains were gold you\\'d be poorer than Weasley, and\\nthat\\'s saying something.\"\\nRon\\'s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety\\nabout Harry.\\n\"I\\'m warning you, Malfoy -- one more word\\n\"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry --\"\\n\"What? Where?\"179Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and\\ncheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in hermouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\\n\"You\\'re in luck, Weasley, Potter\\'s obviously spotted some money on the\\nground!\" said Malfoy.\\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of\\nhim, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered overthe back of his seat to help.\\n\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as\\nHarry sped straight at Snape -- she didn\\'t even notice Malfoy and Ron\\nrolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from thewhirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see\\nsomething scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next\\nsecond, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the\\nSnitch clasped in his hand.\\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember\\nthe Snitch being caught so quickly.\\n\"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\\'s over! Harry\\'s won! We\\'ve won!\\nGryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on\\nher seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\\'t believe\\nit. He\\'d done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted fiveminutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land\\nnearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his\\nshoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\\'s smiling face.\\n\"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.\\n\"Nice to see you haven\\'t been brooding about that mirror... been keepingbusy... excellent...\"\\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two\\nThousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\\'t ever remember feeling180happier. He\\'d really done something to be proud of now -- no one could\\nsay he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had neversmelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hourin his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift himonto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up anddown, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked\\nup at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.Gryffindor in the lead. He\\'d done it, he\\'d shown Snape....\\nAnd speaking of Snape...\\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly\\nnot wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward theforbidden forest. Harry\\'s victory faded from his mind as he watched. Herecognized the figure\\'s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forestwhile everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?\\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding\\nsilently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. Hefollowed.\\nThe trees were so thick he couldn\\'t see where Snape had gone. He flew in\\ncircles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until heheard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering\\nbeech tree.\\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his\\nbroomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowyclearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\\'t alone. Quirrell was there, too.Harry couldn\\'t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering\\nworse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\\n\"... d-don\\'t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,\\nSeverus...\"\\n\"Oh, I thought we\\'d keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy.\\n\"Students aren\\'t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, after\\nall.\"\\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted\\nhim.181\"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\\'s yet?\"\\n\"B-b-but Severus, I --\"\"You don\\'t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step\\ntoward him.\\n\"I-I don\\'t know what you\"You know perfectly well what I mean.\"An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied\\nhimself in time to hear Snape say, \"-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.\\nI\\'m waiting.\"\\n\"B-but I d-d-don\\'t --\"\"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We\\'ll have another little chat soon, when\\nyou\\'ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties\\nlie.\"\\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was\\nalmost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still asthough he was petrified.\\n\"Harry, where have you been?\" Hermione squeaked.\\n\"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And\\nI gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goylesingle-handed! He\\'s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he\\'ll be allright - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone\\'s waiting for you in the\\ncommon room, we\\'re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and\\nstuff from the kitchens.\"\\n\"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let\\'s find an empty\\nroom, you wait \\'til you hear this....\"\\nHe made sure Peeves wasn\\'t inside before shutting the door behind them,\\nthen he told them what he\\'d seen and heard.\\n\"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, and Snape\\'s trying to\\nforce Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past182Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell\\'s \\'hocus pocuss-- I reckon\\nthere are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads ofenchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Artsspell that Snape needs to break through --\"\\n\"So you mean the Stone\\'s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to\\nSnape?\" said Hermione in alarm.\\n\"It\\'ll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.\\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they\\'d thought. In the\\nweeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but itdidn\\'t look as though he\\'d cracked yet.\\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy wasstill growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper,which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passedQuirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ronhad started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell\\'s stutter.\\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. She\\nhad started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.Harry and Ron wouldn\\'t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do thesame.\\n\"Hermione, the exams are ages away.\"\\n\"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That\\'s not ages, that\\'s like a second to\\nNicolas Flamel.\"\\n\"But we\\'re not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \"Anyway, what\\nare you studying for, you already know it A.\"\\n\"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass\\nthese exams to get into the second year? They\\'re very important, Ishould have started studying a month ago, I don\\'t know what\\'s gotteninto me....\"183Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines\\nas Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easterholidays weren\\'t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hardto relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\\'sblood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron\\nspent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get\\nthrough all their extra work.\\n\"I\\'ll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down\\nhis quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was thefirst really fine day they\\'d had in months. The sky was a clear,forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\\nHarry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and\\nFungi, didn\\'t look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What are youdoing in the library?\"\\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked\\nvery out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\\n\"Jus\\' lookin\\',\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at\\nonce. \"An\\' what\\'re you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \"Yernot still lookin\\' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \"Oh, we found out who heis ages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \"And we know what that dog\\'sguarding, it\\'s a Sorcerer\\'s St --\"\\n\"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.\\n\"Don\\' go shoutin\\' about it, what\\'s the matter with yeh?\"\\n\"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said\\nHarry, \"about what\\'s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --\"\\n\"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \"Listen - come an\\' see me later, I\\'m not\\npromisin\\' I\\'ll tell yeh anythin\\', mind, but don\\' go rabbitin\\' about itin here, students aren\\' s\\'pposed ter know. They\\'ll think I\\'ve told yeh--\"\\n\"See you later, then,\" said Harry.\\nHagrid shuffled off.\\n\"What was he hiding behind his back?\" said Hermione thoughtfully.184\"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\"\\n\"I\\'m going to see what section he was in,\" said Ron, who\\'d had enough of\\nworking. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his armsand slammed them down on the table.\\n\"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!\\nLook at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg toInferno, A Dragon Keeper\\'s Guide.\"\\n\"Hagrid\\'s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever\\nmet him, \" said Harry.\\n\"But it\\'s against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed by\\nthe Warlocks\\' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\\'s hard to stopMuggles from noticing us if we\\'re keeping dragons in the back garden -anyway, you can\\'t tame dragons, it\\'s dangerous. You should see the burnsCharlie\\'s got off wild ones in Romania.\"\\n\"But there aren\\'t wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry.\\n\"Of course there are,\" said Ron. \"Common Welsh Green and Hebridean\\nBlacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\\'ve spotted them, tomake them forget.\"\\n\"So what on earths Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione.\\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\\'s hut an hour later,\\nthey were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagridcalled \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door\\nquickly behind them.\\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there\\nwas a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered themstoat sandwiches, which they refused.\\n\"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin\\'?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \"We were\\nwondering if you could tell us what\\'s guarding the Sorcerer\\'s Stoneapart from Fluffy.\"185Hagrid frowned at him.\\n\"0\\' course I cant, he said. \"Number one, I don\\' know meself. Number two,\\nyeh know too much already, so I wouldn\\' tell yeh if I could. ThatStone\\'s here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I\\ns\\'ppose yeh\\'ve worked that out an\\' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\\'\\nFluffy.\"\\n\"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,\\nyou know everything that goes on round here,\" said Hermione in a warm,flattering voice. Hagrid\\'s beard twitched and they could tell he wassmiling. \"We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\" Hermione\\nwent on. \"We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him,\\napart from you.\"\\nHagrid\\'s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at\\nHermione.\\n\"Well, I don\\' s\\'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let\\'s see... he\\nborrowed Fluffy from me... then some o\\' the teachers did enchantments...Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --\" heticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell -- an\\' Dumbledorehimself did somethin\\', o\\' course. Hang on, I\\'ve forgotten someone. Ohyeah, Professor Snape.\"\\n\"Snape?\"\\n\"Yeah -- yer not still on abou\\' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped\\nprotect the Stone, he\\'s not about ter steal it.\"\\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape\\nhad been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out\\nhow the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything --except, it seemed, Quirrell\\'s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\\n\"You\\'re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren\\'t you,\\nHagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn\\'t tell anyone, would you?Not even one of the teachers?\"\\n\"Not a soul knows except me an\\' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly.\\n\"Well, that\\'s something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we186have a window open? I\\'m boiling.\"\\n\"Can\\'t, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the\\nfire. Harry looked at it, too.\\n\"Hagrid -- what\\'s that?\"\\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire,\\nunderneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\\n\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That\\'s er...\"\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get\\na closer look at the egg. \"It must\\'ve cost you a fortune.\"\\n\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las\\' night. I was down in the village havin\\' a\\nfew drinks an\\' got into a game o\\' cards with a stranger. Think he wasquite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\"\\n\"But what are you going to do with it when it\\'s hatched?\" said Hermione.\\n\"Well, I\\'ve bin doin\\' some readin\\' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book\\nfrom under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breedingfor Pleasure and Profit -- it\\'s a bit outta date, o\\' course, but it\\'sall in here. Keep the egg in the fire, \\'cause their mothers breathe on Iem, see, an\\' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\\' brandy mixed with\\nchicken blood every half hour. An\\' see here -- how ter recognize\\ndiff\\'rent eggs -- what I got there\\'s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\\'rerare, them.\"\\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\\'t.\\n\"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said.\\nBut Hagrid wasn\\'t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the\\nfire.\\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to\\nHagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\\n\"Wonder what it\\'s like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening\\nafter evening they struggled through all the extra homework they weregetting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry andRon, too. It was driving them nuts.187Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.\\nHe had written only two words: It\\'s hatching.\\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione\\nwouldn\\'t hear of it.\\n\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\\nhatching?\"\\n\"We\\'ve got lessons, we\\'ll get into trouble, and that\\'s nothing to what\\nHagrid\\'s going to be in when someone finds out what he\\'s doing --\"\\n\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered.\\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How\\nmuch had he heard? Harry didn\\'t like the look on Malfoy\\'s face at all.\\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\\nHermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\\'s with the other two during\\nmorning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of theirlesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurriedthrough the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them,looking flushed and excited.\\n\"It\\'s nearly out.\" He ushered them inside.\\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something\\nwas moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated\\nbreath.\\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby\\ndragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\\'t exactly pretty; Harry thoughtit looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were hugecompared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils,the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\\n\"Isn\\'t he beautiful?\" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke\\nthe dragon\\'s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.188\"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid.\\n\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,\\nexactly?\"\\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face\\n-- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\"Someone was lookin\\' through the gap in the curtains -- it\\'s a kid --\\nhe\\'s runnin\\' back up ter the school.\"\\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no\\nmistaking him.\\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy\\'s face during the next week\\nmade Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of theirfree time in Hagrid\\'s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\\n\"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\"\"I can\\'t,\" said Hagrid. \"He\\'s too little. He\\'d die.\"\\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a\\nweek. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\\'t been doinghis gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. Therewere empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\\n\"I\\'ve decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon\\nwith misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert!Where\\'s Mommy?\"\\n\"He\\'s lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry\\'s ear.\"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert\\'s going to\\nbe as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\"\\nHagrid bit his lip.189\"I -- I know I can\\'t keep him forever, but I can\\'t jus\\' dump him, I\\ncan\\'t.\"\\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said.\"You\\'re losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I\\'m Ron, remember?\"\\n\"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.\\nWe could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then puthim back in the wild!\"\\n\"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\"\\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to\\nask him.\\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry\\nsitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone tobed. The clock on the wall had just\\nchimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of\\nnowhere as he pulled off Harry\\'s invisibility cloak. He had been down atHagrid\\'s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats bythe crate.\\n\"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a\\nbloody handkerchief. \"I\\'m not going to be able to hold a quill for a\\nweek. I tell you, that dragon\\'s the most horrible animal I\\'ve ever met,but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\\'d think it was a fluffy littlebunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And whenI left, he was singing it a lullaby.\"\\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\\n\"It\\'s Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She\\'ll have\\nCharlie\\'s answer!\"\\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.\\nDear Ron,\\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter -- I\\'d be glad to take the Norwegian\\nRidgeback, but it won\\'t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing190will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to\\nvisit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\\'t be seen carrying an illegaldragon.\\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on\\nSaturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it\\'s still\\ndark.\\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.Love,Charlie\\nThey looked at one another.\\n\"We\\'ve got the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn\\'t be too\\ndifficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us andNorbert.\"\\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two\\nagreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.\\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\\'s bitten hand had swollen to\\ntwice its usual size. He didn\\'t know whether it was safe to go to MadamPomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though,\\nhe had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked\\nas if Norbert\\'s fangs were poisonous.\\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day\\nto find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\\n\"It\\'s not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it\\'s\\nabout to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one ofmy books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He keptthreatening to tell her what really bit me -- I\\'ve told her it was adog, but I don\\'t think she believes me -I shouldn\\'t have hit him at theQuidditch match, that\\'s why he\\'s doing this.\"\\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\\n\"It\\'ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this\\ndidn\\'t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke191into a sweat.\\n\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no -- I\\'ve\\njust remembered -- Charlie\\'s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\\'sgoing to know we\\'re getting rid of Norbert.\"\\nHarry and Hermione didn\\'t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came\\nover at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\\n\"It\\'s too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven\\'t\\ngot time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chanceto get rid of Norbert. We\\'ll have to risk it. And we have got theinvisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn\\'t know about that.\"\\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail\\nwhen they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\\n\"I won\\'t let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert\\'s at a tricky stage -- nothin\\'\\nI can\\'t handle.\"\\nWhen they told him about Charlie\\'s letter, his eyes filled with tears,\\nalthough that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on theleg.\\n\"Aargh! It\\'s all right, he only got my boot -- jus\\' playin\\' -- he\\'s only\\na baby, after all.\"\\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry\\nand Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn\\'t comequickly enough.\\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say\\ngood-bye to Norbert if they hadn\\'t been so worried about what they had\\nto do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit latearriving at Hagrid\\'s hut because they\\'d had to wait for Peeves to getout of their way in the entrance hall, where he\\'d been playing tennisagainst the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\\n\"He\\'s got lots o\\' rats an\\' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in\\na muffled voice. \"An\\' I\\'ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets\\nlonely.\"\\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as192though the teddy was having his head torn off.\\n\"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the\\ncrate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.\"Mommy will never forget you!\"\\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never\\nknew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marblestaircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP anotherstaircase, then another -- even one of Harry\\'s shortcuts didn\\'t make thework much easier.\\n\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the\\ntallest tower.\\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.\\nForgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into theshadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with eachother ten feet away. A lamp flared.\\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by\\nthe ear.\\n\"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering\\naround in the middle of the night, how dare you --\"\\n\"You don\\'t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\\'s coming -- he\\'s got a\\ndragon!\"\\n\"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see\\nProfessor Snape about you, Malfoy!\"\\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest\\nthing in the world after that. Not until they\\'d stepped out into thecold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breatheproperly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\\n\"Malfoy\\'s got detention! I could sing!\"\\n\"Don\\'t,\" Harry advised her.\\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his\\ncrate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out193of the darkness.\\nCharlie\\'s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the\\nharness they\\'d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry andHermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.\\nAt last, Norbert was going... going... gone.\\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as\\ntheir hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy indetention -- what could spoil their happiness?\\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they\\nstepped into the corridor, Filch\\'s face loomed suddenly out of thedarkness.\\n\"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\"\\nThey\\'d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.\\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\\nTHE FORIBIDDEN FOREST\\nThings couldn\\'t have been worse.\\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall\\'s study on the first floor,\\nwhere they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermionewas trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased eachother around Harry\\'s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\\'t\\nsee how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were\\ncornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept fortheir being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead ofnight, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which wasout-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibilitycloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\\nHad Harry thought that things couldn\\'t have been worse? He was wrong.\\nWhen Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.194\"Harry!\" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was\\ntrying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going tocatch you, he said you had a drag --\"\\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor\\nMcGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert\\nas she towered over the three of them.\\n\"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were\\nup in the astronomy tower. It\\'s one o\\'clock in the morning. Explainyourselves.\"\\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\\'s\\nquestion. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\\n\"I think I\\'ve got a good idea of what\\'s been going on,\" said Professor\\nMcGonagall. \"It doesn\\'t take a genius to work it out. You fed DracoMalfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out ofbed and into trouble. I\\'ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\\'s\\nfunny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\"\\nHarry caught Neville\\'s eye and tried to tell him without words that this\\nwasn\\'t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor,blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try andfind them in the dark, to warn them.\\n\"I\\'m disgusted,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Four students out of bed in\\none night! I\\'ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, Ithought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindormeant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions --yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk aroundschool at night, especially these days, it\\'s very dangerous -- and fifty\\npoints will be taken from Gryffindor.\"\\n\"Fifty?\" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he\\'d won in\\nthe last Quidditch match.\\n\"Fifty points each,\" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily\\nthrough her long, pointed nose.\\n\"Professor -- please\\n\"You can\\'t --\"195\"Don\\'t tell me what I can and can\\'t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all\\nof you. I\\'ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\"\\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In\\none night, they\\'d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house\\ncup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How\\ncould they ever make up for this?\\nHarry didn\\'t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his\\npillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\\'t think of anything tosay to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading thedawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what\\nthey\\'d done?\\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the\\nhouse points the next day thought there\\'d been a mistake. How could theysuddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And thenthe story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter,\\ntheir hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points,\\nhim and a couple of other stupid first years.\\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,\\nHarry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffsturned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin losethe house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\\'t trouble\\nto lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other\\nhand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \"ThanksPotter, we owe you one!\"\\nOnly Ron stood by him.\\n\"They\\'ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads\\nof points in all the time they\\'ve been here, and people still likethem.\"\\n\"They\\'ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have\\nthey?\" said Harry miserably.\\n\"Well -- no,\" Ron admitted.\\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not\\nto meddle in things that weren\\'t his business from now on. He\\'d had it196with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he\\nwent to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\\n\"Resign?\" Wood thundered. \"What good\\'ll that do? How are we going to get\\nany points back if we can\\'t win at Quidditch?\"\\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\\'t speak\\nto Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, theycalled him \"the Seeker.\"\\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\\'t have as bad a time\\nas Harry, because they weren\\'t as well-known, but nobody would speak tothem, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in\\nclass, keeping her head down and working in silence.\\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren\\'t far away. All the studying\\nhe had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept tothemselves, working late into the night, trying to remember theingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart,\\nmemorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....\\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\\'s new\\nresolution not to interfere in anything that didn\\'t concern him was putto an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own oneafternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As hedrew closer, he heard Quirrell\\'s voice.\\n\"No -- no -- not again, please --\"\\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\"All right -- all right --\" he heard Quirrell sob.\\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening\\nhis turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. Hestrode out of sight; Harry didn\\'t think Quirrell had even noticed him.He waited until Quirrell\\'s footsteps had disappeared, then peered intothe classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he\\'d promised\\nhimself about not meddling.\\nAll the same, he\\'d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\\'s Stones that Snape had\\njust left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be197walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given\\nin at last.\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\\nAstronomy. Harry told them what he\\'d heard.\\n\"Snape\\'s done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell\\'s told him how to break\\nhis Anti-Dark Force spell --\"\\n\"There\\'s still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione.\"Maybe Snape\\'s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\"\\nsaid Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet\\nthere\\'s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant\\nthree-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\"\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\\'s eyes, but Hermione\\nanswered before Harry could.\\n\"Go to Dumbledore. That\\'s what we should have done ages ago. If we try\\nanything ourselves we\\'ll be thrown out for sure.\"\\n\"But we\\'ve got no proof!\" said Harry. \"Quirrell\\'s too scared to back us\\nup. Snape\\'s only got to say he doesn\\'t know how the troll got in atHalloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do youthink they\\'ll believe, him or us? It\\'s not exactly a secret we hate him,\\nDumbledore\\'ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\\'t help\\nus if his life depended on it, he\\'s too friendly with Snape, and themore students get thrown out, the better, he\\'ll think. And don\\'t forget,we\\'re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\\'ll take a lotof explaining.\"\\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\\'t.\\n\"If we just do a bit of poking around --\"\"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we\\'ve done enough poking around.\"He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of\\nits moons.\\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and\\nNeville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:198Your detention will take place at eleven o\\'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch\\nin the entrance hall.\\nProfessor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do\\nin the furor over the points they\\'d lost. He half expected Hermione to\\ncomplain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn\\'t\\nsay a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\\'d got.\\nAt eleven o\\'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common\\nroom and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was alreadythere -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy hadgotten a detention, too.\\n\"Follow me,\" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\\nI bet you\\'ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\\'t you,\\neh?\" he said, leering at them. \"Oh yes... hard work and pain are thebest teachers if you ask me.... It\\'s just a pity they let the old\\npunishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a\\nfew days, I\\'ve got the chains still in my office, keep \\'em well oiled incase they\\'re ever needed.... Right, off we go, and don\\'t think ofrunning off, now, it\\'ll be worse for you if you do.\"\\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry\\nwondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something\\nreally horrible, or Filch wouldn\\'t be sounding so delighted.\\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them\\ninto darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\\'shut. Then they heard a distant shout.\\n\"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\"\\nHarry\\'s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\\nwouldn\\'t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, becauseFilch said, \"I suppose you think you\\'ll be enjoying yourself with thatoaf? Well, think again, boy -- it\\'s into the forest you\\'re going and I\\'mmuch mistaken if you\\'ll all come out in one piece.\"\\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his\\ntracks.199\"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn\\'t sound quite as cool as usual.\\n\"We can\\'t go in there at night -- there\\'s all sorts of things in there-- werewolves, I heard.\"\\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry\\'s robe and made a choking noise.\\n\"That\\'s your problem, isn\\'t it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with\\nglee. \"Should\\'ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble,shouldn\\'t you?\"\\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He\\nwas carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over hisshoulder.\\n\"Abou\\' time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin\\' fer half an hour already. All\\nright, Harry, Hermione?\"\\n\"I shouldn\\'t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\" said Filch coldly,\\nthey\\'re here to be punished, after all.\"\\n\"That\\'s why yer late, is it?\" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \"Bin\\nlecturin\\' them, eh? \\'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\\'ve done yer bit,I\\'ll take over from here.\"\\n\"I\\'ll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what\\'s left of them,\" he added\\nnastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp\\nbobbing away in the darkness.\\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid.\"I\\'m not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear\\nthe note of panic in his voice.\\n\"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\" said Hagrid fiercely.\\n\"Yeh\\'ve done wrong an\\' now yehve got ter pay fer it.\"\\n\"But this is servant stuff, it\\'s not for students to do. I thought we\\'d\\nbe copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\\'d\\ntell yer that\\'s how it is at Hogwarts,\" Hagrid growled. \"Copyin\\' lines!\\nWhat good\\'s that ter anyone? Yeh\\'ll do summat useful or Yeh\\'ll get out.If yeh think yer father\\'d rather you were expelled, then get back offter the castle an\\' pack. Go on\"\\'200Malfoy didn\\'t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his\\ngaze.\\n\"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully, \\'cause it\\'s dangerous\\nwhat we\\'re gonna do tonight, an\\' I don\\' want no one takin\\' risks. Follow\\nme over here a moment.\"\\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he\\npointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into thethick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked intothe forest.\\n\"Look there,\" said Hagrid, \"see that stuff shinin\\' on the ground?\\nSilvery stuff? That\\'s unicorn blood. There\\'s a unicorn in there bin hurtbadly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one deadlast Wednesday. We\\'re gonna try an\\' find the poor thing. We might haveter put it out of its misery.\"\\n\"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\" said Malfoy,\\nunable to keep the fear out of his voice.\\n\"There\\'s nothin\\' that lives in the forest that\\'ll hurt yeh if yer with\\nme or Fang,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' keep ter the path. Right, now, we\\'regonna split inter two parties an\\' follow the trail in diff\\'rentdirections. There\\'s blood all over the place, it must\\'ve bin staggerin\\'\\naround since last night at least.\"\\n\"I want Fang,\" said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\\'s long teeth.\"All right, but I warn yeh, he\\'s a coward,\" said Hagrid. \" So me, Harry,\\nan\\' Hermione\\'ll go one way an\\' Draco, Neville, an\\' Fang\\'ll go the other.\\nNow, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\\'ll send up green sparks, right?\\nGet yer wands out an\\' practice now -- that\\'s it -- an\\' if anyone gets introuble, send up red sparks, an\\' we\\'ll all come an\\' find yeh -- so, becareful -- let\\'s go.\"\\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a\\nfork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left\\npath while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.\\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a\\nray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue201blood on the fallen leaves.\\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked.\\n\"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It\\'s not easy ter catch a unicorn,\\nthey\\'re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\"\\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;\\nthere must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots ofunicorn blood here and there along the winding path.\\n\"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don\\' worry, it can\\'t\\'ve\\ngone far if it\\'s this badly hurt, an\\' then we\\'ll be able ter -- GETBEHIND THAT TREE!\"\\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a\\ntowering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow,\\nraising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was\\nslithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailingalong the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a fewseconds, the sound faded away.\\n\"I knew it, \" he murmured. \"There\\'s summat in here that shouldn\\' be.\"\\n\"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested.\\n\"That wasn\\' no werewolf an\\' it wasn\\' no unicorn, neither,\" said Hagrid\\ngrimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\"\\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.\\nSuddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\\n\"Who\\'s there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself -- I\\'m armed!\"And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a\\nman, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\\'s gleamingchestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\\'s jaws\\ndropped.\\n\"Oh, it\\'s you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\"202He walked forward and shook the centaur\\'s hand.\\n\"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful\\nvoice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\"\\n\"Can\\'t be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.\\n\"There\\'s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\\'\\nHermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\\' this isRonan, you two. He\\'s a centaur.))\\n\"We\\'d noticed,\" said Hermione faintly.\"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn much,\\nup at the school?\"\\n\"Erm --\"\"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly.\\n\"A bit. Well, that\\'s something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head\\nand stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\"\\n\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I\\'m glad we\\'ve run inter\\nyeh, Ronan, \\'cause there\\'s a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin\\'?\"\\nRonan didn\\'t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then\\nsighed again.\\n\"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said. \"So it has been\\nfor ages past, so it is now.\"\\n\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin\\', Ronan? Anythin\\'\\nunusual?\"\\n\"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him\\nimpatiently. \"Unusually bright.\"\\n\"Yeah, but I was meanin\\' anythin\\' unusual a bit nearer home, said\\nHagrid. \"So yeh haven\\'t noticed anythin\\' strange?\"\\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \"The forest\\nhides many secrets.\"203A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,\\nbut it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied andwilder-looking than Ronan.\\n\"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\"\\n\"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\"\\n\"Well enough. Look, I\\'ve jus\\' bin askin\\' Ronan, you seen anythin\\' odd in\\nhere lately? There\\'s a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin\\'about it?\"\\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \"Mars is\\nbright tonight,\" he said simply.\\n\"We\\'ve heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. \"Well, if either of you do see\\nanythin\\', let me know, won\\'t yeh? We\\'ll be off, then.\"\\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\\nshoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\\n\"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an\\' get a straight answer out of a\\ncentaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\\' closer\\'n themoon.\"\\n\"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione.\\n\"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\\'re\\ngood enough about turnin\\' up if ever I want a word. They\\'re deep, mind,centaurs... they know things... jus\\' don\\' let on much.\"\\n\"D\\'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry.\\n\"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\\'s\\nbin killin\\' the unicorns -- never heard anythin\\' like it before.\"\\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\\nnervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were beingwatched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.\\nThey had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid\\'s\\narm.\\n\"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\"204\"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay on the path, I\\'ll come back\\nfor yeh!\"\\nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking\\nat each other, very scared, until they couldn\\'t hear anything but the\\nrustling of leaves around them.\\n\"You don\\'t think they\\'ve been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione.\"I don\\'t care if Malfoy has, but if something\\'s got Neville... it\\'s our\\nfault he\\'s here in the first place.\"\\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry\\'s\\nseemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.What was going on? Where were the others?\\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\\'s return. Malfoy,\\nNeville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed,\\nhad sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had\\npanicked and sent up the sparks.\\n\"We\\'ll be lucky ter catch anythin\\' now, with the racket you two were\\nmakin\\'. Right, we\\'re changin\\' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an\\'Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\\' this idiot. I\\'m sorry,\" Hagridadded in a whisper to Harry, \"but he\\'ll have a harder time frightenin\\'\\nyou, an\\' we\\'ve gotta get this done.\"\\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\\nwalked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, untilthe path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were sothick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were\\nsplashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been\\nthrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead,through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.\\n\"Look --\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\\nanything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out atodd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on205the dark leaves.\\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\\nfreeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered....Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across theground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood\\ntransfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head\\nover the wound in the animal\\'s side, and began to drink its blood.\\n\"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\"Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded\\nfigure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was\\ndribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward\\nHarry -- he couldn\\'t move for fear.\\nThen a pain like he\\'d never felt before pierced his head; it was as\\nthough his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. Heheard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over\\nHarry, charging at the figure.\\nThe pain in Harry\\'s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a\\nminute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaurwas standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; hehad white-blond hair and a palomino body.\\n\"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\\n\"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?\"The centaur didn\\'t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\\nsapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar\\nthat stood out, livid, on Harry\\'s forehead.\\n\"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid.\\nThe forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride?It will be quicker this way.\\n\"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\\nlegs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\\nclearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks206heaving and sweaty.\\n\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your\\nback! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"\\n\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The\\nquicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"\\n\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we\\nare sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not readwhat is to come in the movements of the planets?\"\\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \"I\\'m sure Firenze thought he was\\nacting for the best, \" he said in his gloomy voice.\\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\\nwhat has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like\\ndonkeys after stray humans in our forest!\"\\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had\\nto grab his shoulders to stay on.\\n\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not\\nunderstand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that\\nsecret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes,\\nwith humans alongside me if I must.\"\\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\\nthey plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\\nHarry didn\\'t have a clue what was going on.\\n\"Why\\'s Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from,\\nanyway?\"\\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of\\nlow-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\\'s question. They made\\ntheir way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought\\nFirenze didn\\'t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through aparticularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenlystopped.207\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?\"\\n\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We\\'ve only used the\\nhorn and tail hair in Potions.\"\\n\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said\\nFirenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain,would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive,even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You haveslain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will havebut a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches yourlips.\"\\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze\\'s head, which was dappled silver in\\nthe moonlight.\\n\"But who\\'d be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you\\'re going to be\\ncursed forever, deaths better, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long\\nenough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back tofull strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this verymoment?\"\\n\"The Sorcerer\\'s Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don\\'t\\nunderstand who --\"\\n\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,\\nwho has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"\\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\\'s\\nheart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more whatHagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died.Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him todie.\"\\n\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\"\\n\"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\"\\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along208behind her.\\n\"I\\'m fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The\\nunicorn\\'s dead, Hagrid, it\\'s in that clearing back there.\"\\n\"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\\nexamine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\"\\nHarry slid off his back.\"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read\\nwrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of thosetimes.\"\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry\\nshivering behind him.\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to\\nreturn. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly\\nshook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as\\nHarry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\nHarry couldn\\'t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He\\nwas still shaking.\\n\"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort\\'s waiting in the\\nforest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get\\nrich....\"\\n\"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he\\nthought Voldemort could hear them.\\nHarry wasn\\'t listening.\\n\"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn\\'t have done so.... Bane was furious...\\nhe was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going tohappen.... They must show that Voldemort\\'s coming back.... Bane thinksFirenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose that\\'s writtenin the stars as well.\"\\n\"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed.\\n\"So all I\\'ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry209went on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me\\noff... Well, I suppose Bane\\'ll be happy.\"\\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore\\'s the only one You-Know-Who was ever\\nafraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\\'t touch you. Anyway,\\nwho says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,and Professor McGonagall says that\\'s a very imprecise branch of magic.\"\\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed\\nexhausted, their throats sore. But the night\\'s surprises weren\\'t over.\\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak\\nfolded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\\nJust in case.\\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOORIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to\\nget through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come burstingthrough the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could\\nbe no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did\\ntheir written papers. They had been given special, new quills for theexams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by\\none into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance acrossa desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox-- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away ifit had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their neckswhile they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his\\nforehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into theforest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves becauseHarry couldn\\'t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by210his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there\\nwas a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\\nMaybe it was because they hadn\\'t seen what Harry had seen in the forest,\\nor because they didn\\'t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ronand Hermione didn\\'t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea\\nof Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\\'t keep visiting them in\\ndreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\\'t have muchtime to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering\\nquestions about batty old wizards who\\'d invented selfstirring cauldronsand they\\'d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam\\nresults came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put\\ndown their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\\'t helpcheering with the rest.\\n\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they\\njoined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn\\'t have\\nlearned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of\\nElfric the Eager.\"\\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron\\nsaid this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake andflopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling thetentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No\\nmore studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You\\ncould look more cheerful, Harry, we\\'ve got a week before we find out howbadly we\\'ve done, there\\'s no need to worry yet.\"\\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\\n\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps\\nhurting -- it\\'s happened before, but never as often as this.\"\\n\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested.\"I\\'m not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it\\'s a warning... it means danger\\'s\\ncoming....\"\\nRon couldn\\'t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n\"Harry, relax, Hermione\\'s right, the Stone\\'s safe as long as211Dumbledore\\'s around. Anyway, we\\'ve never had any proof Snape found out\\nhow to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\\'s notgoing to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch forEngland before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\"\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn\\'t shake off a lurking feeling that there was\\nsomething he\\'d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to\\nexplain this, Hermione said, \"That\\'s just the exams. I woke up lastnight and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before Iremembered we\\'d done that one.\"\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\\'t have anything to do\\nwith work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across\\nthe bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only\\none who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --\\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.\\n\"Where\\'re you going?\" said Ron sleepily.\\n\"I\\'ve just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white.\\n\"We\\'ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\"\\n\"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\\n\"Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy\\nslope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, anda stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? Howmany people wander around with dragon eggs if it\\'s against wizard law?Lucky they found Hagrid, don\\'t you think? Why didn\\'t I see it before?\"\\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the\\ngrounds toward the forest, didn\\'t answer.\\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and\\nsleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\\n\"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\"\\n\"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\\n\"No, we\\'re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\\'ve got to ask you something. You know212that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards\\nwith look like?\"\\n\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn\\' take his cloak off.\"He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\\n\"It\\'s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\\' funny folk in the Hog\\'s Head --\\nthat\\'s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\\'he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\"\\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to him\\nabout, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\"\\n\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.\\n\"Yeah... he asked what I did, an\\' I told him I was gamekeeper here....He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I toldhim... an\\' I said what I\\'d always really wanted was a dragon... an\\'then... I can\\' remember too well, \\'cause he kept buyin\\' me drinks....\\nLet\\'s see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\\' we could play\\ncards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, hedidn\\' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, adragon would be easy...\"\\n\"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, try ing\\nto keep his voice calm.\\n\"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d\\'yeh meet, even around\\nHogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\\'s a piece o\\' cake if yeh know how tocalm him down, jus\\' play him a bit o\\' music an\\' he\\'ll go straight offter sleep --\"\\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\\n\"I shouldn\\'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey --\\nwhere\\'re yeh goin\\'?\"\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn\\'t speak to each other at all until they\\ncame to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy\\nafter the grounds.\\n\"We\\'ve got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger\\nhow to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that213cloak -- it must\\'ve been easy, once he\\'d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope\\nDumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\\'t stophim. Where\\'s Dumbledore\\'s office?\"\\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the\\nright direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor\\ndid they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\\n\"We\\'ll just have to --\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across\\nthe hall.\\n\"What are you three doing inside?\"\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\\n\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely,\\nHarry and Ron thought.\\n\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though\\nthis was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\"\\nHarry swallowed -- now what?\"It\\'s sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn\\'t, because\\nProfessor McGonagall\\'s nostrils flared.\\n\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He\\nreceived an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off forLondon at once.\"\\n\"He\\'s gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\"\\n\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many\\ndemands on his time --\\n\"But this is important.\"\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic,\\nPotter.\\n\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor -- it\\'s\\nabout the Sorcerer\\'s tone --\"214Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\\'t that. The books\\nshe was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\\'t pick them up.\"How do you know --?\" she spluttered.\\n\"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone\\'s going to try\\nand steal the Stone. I\\'ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\"\\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\\n\"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. I don\\'t\\nknow how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one canpossibly steal it, it\\'s too well protected.\"\\n\"But Professor --\"\\n\"Potter, I know what I\\'m talking about,\" she said shortly. She bent down\\nand gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside andenjoy the sunshine.\"\\nBut they didn\\'t.\\n\"It\\'s tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was\\nout of earshot. \"Snape\\'s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\\'s foundout everything he needs, and now he\\'s got Dumbledore out of the way. Hesent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock whenDumbledore turns up.\"\\n\"But what can we --\"\\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.Snape was standing there.\\n\"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly.\\nThey stared at him.\"You shouldn\\'t be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd,\\ntwisted smile.\\n\"We were --\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\\n\"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around215like this, people will think you\\'re up to something. And Gryffindor\\nreally can\\'t afford to lose any more points, can it?\"\\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\\n\"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will\\npersonally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\"\\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\\n\"Right, here\\'s what we\\'ve got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us\\nhas got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room andfollow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\\'d better do that.\"\\n\"Why me?\"\\n\"It\\'s obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\\nFlitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \"\\'Oh Professor Flitwick,I\\'m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....\\'\"\\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for\\nSnape.\\n\"And we\\'d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron.\\n\"Come on.\"\\nBut that part of the plan didn\\'t work. No sooner had they reached the\\ndoor separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than ProfessorMcGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\\n\"I suppose you think you\\'re harder to get past than a pack of\\nenchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you \\'vecome anywhere near here again, I\\'ll take another fifty points fromGryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\" Harry and Ron went back tothe common room, Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione\\'s on Snape\\'stail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came\\nin.\\n\"I\\'m sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I was\\ndoing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him,216and I\\'ve only just got away, I don\\'t know where Snape went.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s it then, isn\\'t it?\" Harry said.The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\\n\"I\\'m going out of here tonight and I\\'m going to try and get to the Stone\\nfirst.\"\\n\"You\\'re mad!\" said Ron.\"You can\\'t!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have said?\\nYou\\'ll be expelled!\"\\n\"SO WHAP\" Harry shouted. \"Don\\'t you understand? If Snape gets hold of\\nthe Stone, Voldemort\\'s coming back! Haven\\'t you heard what it was likewhen he was trying to take over? There won\\'t be any Hogwarts to getexpelled from! He\\'ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the DarkArts! Losing points doesn\\'t matter anymore, can\\'t you see? D\\'you think\\nhe\\'ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house\\ncup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\\'ll have togo back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\\'sonly dying a bit later than I would have, because I\\'m never going overto the Dark Side! I\\'m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothingyou two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\"\\nHe glared at them.\\n\"You\\'re right Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice.\"I\\'ll use the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It\\'s just lucky I got it\\nback.\"\\n\"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron.\\n\"All -- all three of us?\"\"Oh, come off it, you don\\'t think we\\'d let you go alone?\"\\n\"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you\\'d get to\\nthe Stone without us? I\\'d better go and took through my books, theremight be something useful...\"217\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\"\\n\"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in\\nsecret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\\'re notthrowing me out after that.\"\\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.\\nNobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say toHarry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\\'t been upsetby it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to comeacross one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harryand Ron didn\\'t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what theywere about to do.\\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\\n\"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,\\nstretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. Heputted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had\\ngiven him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn\\'t\\nfeel much like singing.\\nHe ran back down to the common room.\"We\\'d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of\\nus -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --\"\\n\"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville\\nappeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who lookedas though he\\'d been making another bid for freedom.\\n\"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak\\nbehind his back.\\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.\"You\\'re going out again,\" he said.\"No, no, no,\" said Hermione. \"No, we\\'re not. Why don\\'t you go to bed,\\nNeville?\"\\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\\'t afford\\nto waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.218\"You can\\'t go out,\" said Neville, \"you\\'ll be caught again. Gryffindor\\nwill be in even more trouble.\"\\n\"You don\\'t understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\"\\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\\nI won\\'t let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the\\nportrait hole. \"I\\'ll -- I\\'ll fight you!\"\\n\"Neville, \"Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don\\'t be an idiot\\n--\"\\n\"Don\\'t you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. I don\\'t think you should be\\nbreaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up topeople!\"\\n\"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don\\'t know\\nwhat you\\'re doing.\"\\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt\\nout of sight.\\n\"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I\\'m\\nready!\"\\nHarry turned to Hermione.\\n\"Do something,\" he said desperately.Hermione stepped forward.\\n\"Neville,\" she said, \"I\\'m really, really sorry about this.\"\\nShe raised her wand.\"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville.\\nNeville\\'s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole\\nbody rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face,stiff as a board.219Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville\\'s jaws were jammed together so he\\ncouldn\\'t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\\n\"What\\'ve you done to him?\" Harry whispered.\"It\\'s the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I\\'m so\\nsorry.\"\\n\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry.\"You\\'ll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him\\nand pulled on the invisibility cloak.\\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\\'t feel like a\\nvery good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\\'s shadow lookedlike Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swoopingdown on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs.Norris skulking near the top.\\n\"Oh, let\\'s kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry\\'s ear, but\\nHarry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norristurned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\\'t do anything.\\nThey didn\\'t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\\nthird floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so thatpeople would trip.\\n\"Who\\'s there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed\\nhis wicked black eyes. \"Know you\\'re there, even if I can\\'t see you. Areyou ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\"\\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\\n\"Should call Filch, I should, if something\\'s a-creeping around unseen.\"\\nHarry had a sudden idea.\"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own\\nreasons for being invisible.\"\\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time\\nand hovered about a foot off the stairs.220\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily. \"My\\nmistake, my mistake -- I didn\\'t see you -- of course I didn\\'t, you\\'reinvisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\"\\n\"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this\\nplace tonight.\"\\n\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air\\nagain. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I\\'ll not bother you.\"\\nAnd he scooted off\"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron.\\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor\\n-- and the door was already ajar.\\n\"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape\\'s already got past\\nFluffy.\"\\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\\nwhat was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the othertwo.\\n\"If you want to go back, I won\\'t blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the\\ncloak, I won\\'t need it now.\"\\n\"Don\\'t be stupid,\" said Ron.\\n\"We\\'re coming,\" said Hermione.Harry pushed the door open.\\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of\\nthe dog\\'s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though itcouldn\\'t see them.\\n\"What\\'s that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered.\\n\"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\"\\n\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here\\ngoes...\"221He put Hagrid\\'s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\\'t really a tune, but\\nfrom the first note the beast\\'s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drewbreath. Slowly, the dog\\'s growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws andfell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\\n\"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\\ncrept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\\'s hot, smelly breathas they approached the giant heads. \"I think we\\'ll be able to pull thedoor open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog\\'s back. \"Want to go first,Hermione?\"\\n\"No, I don\\'t!\"\\n\"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\\'s\\nlegs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up andopen.\\n\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously.\\n\"Nothing -- just black -- there\\'s no way of climbing down, we\\'ll just\\nhave to drop.\"\\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his\\nattention and pointed at himself.\\n\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don\\'t know how deep\\nthis thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\"\\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\\' silence, the dog\\ngrowled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fellback into its deep sleep.\\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no\\nsign of the bottom.\\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\\nfingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens tome, don\\'t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\\nDumbledore, right?\"\\n\"Right,\" said Ron.222\"See you in a minute, I hope...\\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,\\ndown and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed onsomething soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to thegloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.\\n\"It\\'s okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,\\nwhich was the open trapdoor, \"it\\'s a soft landing, you can jump!\"\\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\"What\\'s this stuff?\" were his first words.\\n\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\\'s here to break the fall.\\nCome on, Hermione!\"\\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\\nHermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\\'s other side.\\n\"We must be miles under the school , she said.\\n\"Lucky this plant thing\\'s here, really,\" said Ron.\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\"\\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\\nbecause the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twistsnakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legshad already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\\nher. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant\\noff them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and fasterthe plant wound around them.\\n\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is -- it\\'s\\nDevil\\'s Snare!\"\\n\"Oh, I\\'m so glad we know what it\\'s called, that\\'s a great help,\" snarled\\nRon, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around hisneck. \"Shut up, I\\'m trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione.223\"Well, hurry up, I can\\'t breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\\ncurled around his chest.\\n\"Devil\\'s Snare, Devil\\'s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it\\nlikes the dark and the damp\\n\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.\\n\"Yes -- of course -- but there\\'s no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her\\nhands.\\n\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\"\\n\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\\nmuttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she hadused on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt itloosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and theywere able to pull free.\\n\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he\\njoined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn\\'t lose his head in a crisis --\\n\\'there\\'s no wood,\\' honestly.\"\\n\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the\\nonly way forward.\\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of\\nwater trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, andHarry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,\\nhe remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\\'\\nbank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been badenough...\\n\"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered.Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\\nahead.\\n\"Do you think it\\'s a ghost?\"224\"I don\\'t know... sounds like wings to me.\"\\n\"There\\'s light ahead -- I can see something moving.\"They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly\\nlit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,\\njewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the\\nopposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\\n\"Do you think they\\'ll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don\\'t look very vicious, but I suppose if\\nthey all swooped down at once... well, there\\'s no other choice... I\\'ll\\nrun.\"\\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\\nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing athim any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. Hepulled the handle, but it was locked.\\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it\\nwouldn\\'t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\\n\"Now what?\" said Ron.\"These birds... they can\\'t be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione.\\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?\\n\"They\\'re not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They\\'re keys! Winged keys --\\nlook carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber whilethe other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look!\\nBroomsticks! We\\'ve got to catch the key to the door!\"\\n\"But there are hundreds of them!\"Ron examined the lock on the door.\"We\\'re looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the\\nhandle.\"\\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\\nthe midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the225bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to\\ncatch one.\\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\\nhad a knack for spotting things other people didn\\'t. After a minute\\'sweaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large\\nsilver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and\\nstuffed roughly into the keyhole.\\n\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there\\n-- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\\nthe ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\\n\"We\\'ve got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the\\nkey with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione,stay below and stop it from going down and I\\'ll try and catch it. Right,NOW!\"\\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry\\nstreaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward andwith a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with onehand. Ron and Hermione\\'s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in\\nhis hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment\\nthe lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking verybattered now that it had been caught twice.\\n\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\\nnodded. He pulled the door open.\\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn\\'t see anything at all. But as\\nthey stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal anastonishing sight.\\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black\\nchessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what\\nlooked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the\\nwhite pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the toweringwhite chessmen had no faces.226\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.\\n\"It\\'s obvious, isn\\'t it?\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve got to play our way across\\nthe room.\"\\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\\n\"How?\" said Hermione nervously.\\n\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we\\'re going to have to be chessmen.\"He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the\\nknight\\'s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the\\nground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\\n\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\" The black knight\\nnodded. Ron turned to the other two.\\n\"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we\\'ve got to take the\\nplace of three of the black pieces....\"\\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\\n\"Now, don\\'t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good atchess --\"\\n\"We\\'re not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"\\n\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90\\nnext to him instead of that castle.\"\\n\"What about you?\"\\n\"I\\'m going to be a knight,\" said Ron.\\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\\nknight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white piecesand walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,and Hermione took.\\n\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board.\\n\"Yes... look...\"\\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.227Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\\nsent them. Harry\\'s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\\n\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\"\\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\\nqueen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where helay quite still, facedown.\\n\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to\\ntake that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"\\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\\nSoon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were indanger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many whitepieces as they had lost black ones.\\n\"We\\'re nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think let me\\nthink...\"\\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\"Yes...\" said Ron softly, \"It\\'s the only way... I\\'ve got to be taken.\"\\n\"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.\\n\"That\\'s chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You\\'ve got to make some sacrifices! I take\\none step forward and she\\'ll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmatethe king, Harry!\"\\n\"But --\"\\n\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\"\"Ron --\"\"Look, if you don\\'t hurry up, he\\'ll already have the Stone!\"\\nThere was no alternative.\\n\"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go - now,228don\\'t hang around once you\\'ve won.\"\\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard\\nacross the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ronto one side. He looked as if he\\'d been knocked out.\\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\\'s feet. They had\\nwon. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. Withone last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged throughthe door and up the next passageway.\\n\"What if he\\'s --?\"\\n\"He\\'ll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do\\nyou reckon\\'s next?\"\\n\"We\\'ve had Sprout\\'s, that was the Devil\\'s Snare; Flitwick must\\'ve put\\ncharms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make themalive; that leaves Quirrell\\'s spell, and Snape\\'s.\"\\nThey had reached another door.\"All right?\" Harry whispered.\\n\"Go on.\"\\nHarry pushed it open.A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their\\nrobes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in\\nfront of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, outcold with a bloody lump on its head.\\n\"I\\'m glad we didn\\'t have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they\\nstepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can\\'tbreathe.\"\\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what\\ncame next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a tablewith seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.229\"Snape\\'s,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\"\\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind\\nthem in the doorway. It wasn\\'t ordinary fire either; it was purple. Atthe same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.\\nThey were trapped.\\n\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry\\nlooked over her shoulder to read it:\\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\\nTwo of us will help you, which ever you would find,\\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,Another will transport the drinker back instead,\\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\\nThree of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide\\nYou will always find some on nettle wine\\'s left side;Second, different are those who stand at either end,\\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size,Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right\\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.230Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was\\nsmiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\\n\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn\\'t magic -- it\\'s logic -- a puzzle.\\nA lot of the greatest wizards haven\\'t got an ounce of logic, they\\'d bestuck in here forever.\"\\n\"But so will we, won\\'t we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything\\nwe need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two arewine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get usback through the purple.\"\\n\"But how do we know which to drink?\"\\n\"Give me a minute.\"\\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the\\nline of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, sheclapped her hands.\\n\"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black\\nfire -- toward the Stone.\"\\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\"There\\'s only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That\\'s hardly one\\nswallow.\"\\nThey looked at each other.\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\"\\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\\n\"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab\\nbrooms from the flying- key room, they\\'ll get you out of the trapdoorand past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig toDumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while,but I\\'m no match for him, really.\"\\n\"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who\\'s with him?\"\\n\"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn\\'t I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar.231\"I might get lucky again.\"\\nHermione\\'s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\\narms around him.\\n\"Hermione!\"\\n\"Harry -- you\\'re a great wizard, you know.\"\\n\"I\\'m not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of\\nhim.\\n\"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important\\nthings -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!\"\\n\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren\\'t\\nyou?\"\\n\"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle\\nat the end, and shuddered.\\n\"It\\'s not poison?\" said Harry anxiously.\"No -- but it\\'s like ice.\"\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\"\\n\"Good luck -- take care.\"\\n\"GO!\"Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to\\nface the black flames.\\n\"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle\\ndown and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking\\nhis body, but couldn\\'t feel them -- for a moment he could see nothingbut dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.232There was already someone there -- but it wasn\\'t Snape. It wasn\\'t even\\nVoldemort.\\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\\nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES\\nIt was Quirrell.\"You!\" gasped Harry.Quirrell smiled. His face wasn\\'t twitching at all.\\n\"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I\\'d be meeting you here,\\nPotter.\"\\n\"But I thought -- Snape --\"\\n\"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\\'t his usual quivering treble,\\neither, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\\'the? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next tohim, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\"\\nHarry couldn\\'t take it in. This couldn\\'t be true, it couldn\\'t.\\n\"But Snape tried to kill me!\"\\n\"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally\\nknocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditchmatch. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\\'dhave got you off that broom. I\\'d have managed it before then if Snape\\nhadn\\'t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\"\\n\"Snape was trying to save me?\"\"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"\\\\Why do you think he wanted to\\nreferee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\\'t do itagain. Funny, really... he needn\\'t have bothered. I couldn\\'t do anything\\nwith Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was\\ntrying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular...and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\\'m going to kill youtonight.\"233Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped\\nthemselves tightly around Harry.\\n\"You\\'re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on\\nHalloween like that, for all I knew you\\'d seen me coming to look at what\\nwas guarding the Stone.\"\\n\"You let the troll in?\"\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what\\nI did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, whileeveryone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already\\nsuspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not\\nonly did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dogdidn\\'t even manage to bite Snape\\'s leg off properly.\\n\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.\\nIt was the Mirror of Erised.\\n\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured,\\ntapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up withsomething like this... but he\\'s in London... I\\'ll be far away by thetime he gets back....\"\\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\\nfrom concentrating on the mirror.\\n\"I saw you and Snape in the forest --\" he blurted out.\\n\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the\\nback. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\\'d got.He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could,when I had Lord Voldemort on my side....\"\\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into\\nit.\\n\"I see the Stone... I\\'m presenting it to my master... but where is it?\"\\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\\'t give. He234had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\\n\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts\\nwith your father, didn\\'t you know? They loathed each other. But he never\\nwanted you dead.\"\\n\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was\\nthreatening you....\"\\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\\'s face.\\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master\\'s instructions\\n-- he is a great wizard and I am weak --\"\\n\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped.\"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I\\ntraveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of\\nridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrongI was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those tooweak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although Ihave let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\"Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When Ifailed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He\\npunished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me....\"\\nQuirrell\\'s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon\\nAlley -how could he have been so stupid? He\\'d seen Quirrell there thatvery day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\\n\"I don\\'t understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break\\nit?\"\\nHarry\\'s mind was racing.\\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he\\nthought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in themirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I\\'ll see whereit\\'s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\\'m up235to?\\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without\\nQuirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: hetripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking tohimself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\"\\nAnd to Harry\\'s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come\\nfrom Quirrell himself\\n\"Use the boy... Use the boy...\"Quirrell rounded on Harry.\\n\"Yes -- Potter -- come here.\"\\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry\\ngot slowly to his feet.\\n\"Come here,\" Quirrell repeated. \"Look in the mirror and tell me what you\\nsee.\"\\nHarry walked toward him.I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I\\nsee, that\\'s all.\\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that\\nseemed to come from Quirrell\\'s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped infront of the mirror, and opened them again.\\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\\nlater, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and\\npulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in itspocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into hisreal pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he\\'d gotten the Stone.\\n\"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\"\\nHarry screwed up his courage.\\n\"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I -- I\\'ve\\nwon the house cup for Gryffindor.\"236Quirrell cursed again.\\n\"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the\\nSorcerer\\'s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\\nBut he hadn\\'t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though\\nQuirrell wasn\\'t moving his lips.\\n\"He lies... He lies...\"\"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What did\\nyou just see?\"\\nThe high voice spoke again.\\n\"Let me speak to him... face-to-face...\"\"Master, you are not strong enough!\"\\n\"I have strength enough... for this....\"\\nHarry felt as if Devil\\'s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\\'t\\nmove a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began tounwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\\'shead looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the\\nspot.\\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn\\'t make a sound. Where there\\nshould have been a back to Quirrell\\'s head, there was a face, the mostterrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring redeyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\\n\"Harry Potter...\" it whispered.\\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\\'t move.\"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor ... I\\nhave form only when I can share another\\'s body... but there have always\\nbeen those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn\\nblood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrelldrinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life,I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don\\'t you give237me that Stone in your pocket?\"\\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\\'s legs. He\\nstumbled backward.\\n\"Don\\'t be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join\\nme... or you\\'ll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging\\nme for mercy...\"\\n\"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly.Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see\\nhim. The evil face was now smiling.\\n\"How touching...\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your\\nparents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up acourageous fight... but your mother needn\\'t have died... she was tryingto protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to havedied in vain.\"\\n\"NEVER!\"\\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\"\\nand the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\\'s hand close on his wrist. Atonce, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry\\'s scar; his head felt asthough it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his\\nmight, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head\\nlessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, andsaw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blisteringbefore his eyes.\\n\"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged,\\nknocking Harry clean off his feet\\' landing on top of him, both hands\\naround Harry\\'s neck -- Harry\\'s scar was almost blinding him with pain,yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\\n\"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!\"And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go\\nof his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see\\nthey looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\\n\"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.238Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by\\ninstinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\\'s face --\\n\"AAAARGH!\"\\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:\\nQuirrell couldn\\'t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terriblepain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enoughpain to stop him from doing a curse.\\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as\\ntight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the\\npain in Harry\\'s head was building -- he couldn\\'t see -- he could only\\nhear Quirrell\\'s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\\'s yells of, \"KILL HIM!KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry\\'s own head, crying, \"Harry!Harry!\"\\nHe felt Quirrell\\'s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and\\nfell into blackness, down ... down... down...\\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to\\ncatch it, but his arms were too heavy.\\nHe blinked. It wasn\\'t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\\nstrange.\\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view\\nabove him.\\n\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he\\nremembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\\'s got the Stone! Sir,\\nquick --\"\\n\"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said\\nDumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\"\\n\"Then who does? Sir, I --\"\\n\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the\\nhospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next239to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\\n\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What\\nhappened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is acomplete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe yourfriends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to\\nsend you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam\\nPomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscatedit.\"\\n\"How long have I been in here?\"\"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved\\nyou have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"\\n\"But sit, the StoneI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\\nQuirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to\\nprevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\\n\"You got there? You got Hermione\\'s owl?\"\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it\\nbecame clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had justleft. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\"\\n\"It was you.\"\\n\"I feared I might be too late.\"\"You nearly were, I couldn\\'t have kept him off the Stone much longer --\"\\n\"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For\\none terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it hasbeen destroyed.\"\\n\"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --\"\\n\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.\\n\"You did do the thing properly, didn\\'t you? Well, Nicolas and I have hada little chat, and agreed it\\'s all for the best.\"240\"But that means he and his wife will die, won\\'t they?\"\\n\"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then,\\nyes, they will die.\"\\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\\'s face.\\n\"To one as young as you, I\\'m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas\\nand Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very longday. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next greatadventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. Asmuch money and life as you could want! The two things most human beingswould choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of\\nchoosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay\\nthere, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at theceiling.\\n\"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I\\'ve been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone\\'s\\ngone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --\"\\n\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\\nof a name increases fear of the thing itself.\"\\n\"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort\\'s going to try other ways of coming back,\\nisn\\'t he? I mean, he hasn\\'t gone, has he?\"\\n\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\\nfor another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followersas his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed hisreturn to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared tofight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed\\nagain, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"\\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\\nhe said, \"Sir, there are some other things I\\'d like to know, if you cantell me... things I want to know the truth about....\"\\n\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing,\\nand should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall\\nanswer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in whichcase I beg you\\'ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\"241\"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\\nto stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in thefirst place?\"\\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\\n\"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not\\nnow. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you areready, you will know.\"\\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\\n\"But why couldn\\'t Quirrell touch me?\"\\n\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\\nunderstand, it is love. He didn\\'t realize that love as powerful as yourmother\\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... tohave been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone,\\nwill give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,\\nfull of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a personmarked by something so good.\"\\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found\\nhis voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know\\nwho sent it to me?\"\\n\"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought\\nyou might like it.\" Dumbledore\\'s eyes twinkled. \"Useful things... yourfather used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food\\nwhen he was here.\"\\n\"And there\\'s something else...\"\"Fire away.\"\"Quirrell said Snape --\"\\n\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because\\nhe hated my father. Is that true?\"242\"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.\\nMalfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\"\\n\"What?\"\"He saved his life.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"Yes...\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people\\'s minds work,\\nisn\\'t it? Professor Snape couldn\\'t bear being in your father\\'s debt....I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he feltthat would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to\\nhating your father\\'s memory in peace....\"\\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he\\nstopped.\\n\"And sir, there\\'s one more thing...\"\\n\"Just the one?\"\\n\"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\"\"Ah, now, I\\'m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant\\nideas, and between you and me, that\\'s saying something. You see, only\\none who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be\\nable to get it, otherwise they\\'d just see themselves making gold ordrinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now,enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! BettieBott\\'s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to comeacross a vomitflavored one, and since then I\\'m afraid I\\'ve rather lost\\nmy liking for them -- but I think I\\'ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\\'t\\nyou?\"\\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he\\nchoked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\"\\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\\n\"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded.\\n\"Absolutely not.\"243\"You let Professor Dumbledore in...\"\\n\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need\\nrest.\"\\n\"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\\nPomfrey...\"\\n\"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\"And she let Ron and Hermione in.\\n\"Harry!\"\\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was\\nglad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\n\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried\\n--\"\\n\"The whole school\\'s talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\"It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\\nstrange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything:Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a\\nvery good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry\\ntold them what was under Quirrell\\'s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\\n\"So the Stone\\'s gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel\\'s just going to die?\"\"That\\'s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- \\'to\\nthe well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\\n\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed\\nat how crazy his hero was.\\n\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry.\\n\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round --\\nthat took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contactDumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- hejust said, \\'Harry\\'s gone after him, hasn\\'t he?\\' and hurtled off to the244third floor.\"\\n\"D\\'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your\\nfather\\'s cloak and everything?\"\\n\"Well, \" Hermione exploded, \"if he did -- I mean to say that\\'s terrible\\n-- you could have been killed.\"\\n\"No, it isn\\'t,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He\\'s a funny man, Dumbledore.\\nI think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more orless everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a prettygood idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he justtaught us enough to help. I don\\'t think it was an accident he let me\\nfind out how the mirror worked. It\\'s almost like he thought I had the\\nright to face Voldemort if I could....\"\\n\"Yeah, Dumbledore\\'s off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly.\\n\"Listen, you\\'ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. Thepoints are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last\\nQuidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but\\nthe food\\'ll be good.\"\\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\"You\\'ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\" she said firmly.\\nAfter a good night\\'s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\\nI want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened\\nhis many candy boxes. I can, can\\'t I?\"\\n\"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said\\nstiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\'t realize\\nhow risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\"\\n\"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\"Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was\\nindoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry,\\ntook one look at him, and burst into tears.\\n\"It\\'s -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands.\\nI told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only245thing he didn\\'t know, an\\' I told him! Yeh could\\'ve died! All fer a\\ndragon egg! I\\'ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\\' made terlive as a Muggle!\"\\n\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\\nremorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he\\'d have\\nfound out somehow, this is Voldemort we\\'re talking about, he\\'d have\\nfound out even if you hadn\\'t told him.\"\\n\"Yeh could\\'ve died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' say the name!\"\"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped\\ncrying. \"I\\'ve met him and I\\'m calling him by his name. Please cheer up,\\nHagrid, we saved the Stone, it\\'s gone, he can\\'t use it. Have a Chocolate\\nFrog, I\\'ve got loads....\"\\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds\\nme. I\\'ve got yeh a present.\"\\n\"It\\'s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last\\nHagrid gave a weak chuckle. \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day offyesterday ter fix it. \\'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway,got yeh this...\"\\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it\\ncuriously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him\\nfrom every page were his mother and father.\\n\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents\\' old school friends, askin\\' fer\\nphotos... knew yeh didn\\' have any... d\\'yeh like it?\"\\nHarry couldn\\'t speak, but Hagrid understood.\\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He\\nhad been held up by Madam Pomfrey\\'s fussing about, insisting on givinghim one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was deckedout in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin\\'swinning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge bannershowing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started\\ntalking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermioneat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were246standing up to look at him.\\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you\\nwith an old man\\'s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our\\ndelicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a\\nlittle fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to getthem nice and empty before next year starts....\\n\"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the\\npoints stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred andtwelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two;\\nRavenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred\\nand seventy- two.\"\\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.\\nHarry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was asickening sight.\\n\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent\\nevents must be taken into account.\"\\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins\\' smiles faded a little.\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out.\\nLet me see. Yes...\\n\"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\\n\"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I\\naward Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars\\noverhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the otherprefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got pastMcGonagall\\'s giant chess set!\"\\nAt last there was silence again.\\n\"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the247face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had\\nburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were besidethemselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. HarryPotter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve\\nand outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"\\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves\\nhoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points-- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- ifonly Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\\n\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a\\ngreat deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much tostand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. NevilleLongbottom.\"\\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some\\nsort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that eruptedfrom the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell andcheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of peoplehugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who\\ncouldn\\'t have looked more stunned and horrified if he\\'d just had the\\nBody-Bind Curse put on him.\\n\"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even\\nRavenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"weneed a little change of decoration.\"\\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet\\nand the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and atowering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking ProfessorMcGonagall\\'s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\\'s eyeand Harry knew at once that Snape\\'s feelings toward him hadn\\'t changedone jot. This didn\\'t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back\\nto normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\\nIt was the best evening of Harry\\'s life, better than winning at\\nQuidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would248never, ever forget tonight.\\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but\\ncome they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with goodmarks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. EvenNeville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his\\nabysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid\\nas he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was ashame, but as Ron said, you couldn\\'t have everything in life.\\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,\\nNeville\\'s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes werehanded out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the\\nholidays (\"I always hope they\\'ll forget to give us these,\" said Fred\\nWeasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boatsthat sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express;talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier;eating Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns;pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling\\ninto platform nine and three-quarters at King\\'s Cross Station.\\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened\\nold guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gatein twos and threes so they didn\\'t attract attention by all bursting outof a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\\n\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you -- I\\'ll\\nsend you an owl.\"\\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I\\'ll need something to look forward to.\" People\\njostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggleworld. Some of them called:\\n\"Bye, Harry!\"\\n\"See you, Potter!\"\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.\\n\"Not where I\\'m going, I promise you,\" said Harry.\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \"There he is,\\nMom, there he is, look!\"249It was Ginny Weasley, Ron\\'s younger sister, but she wasn\\'t pointing at\\nRon.\\n\"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see\\n\"Be quiet, Ginny, and it\\'s rude to point.\"\\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\"Busy year?\" she said.\"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.\\nWeasley.\"\\n\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\"\"Ready, are you?\"\\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking\\nfurious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a stationfull of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley,looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\\n\"You must be Harry\\'s family!\" said Mrs. Weasley.\\n\"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven\\'t\\ngot all day.\" He walked away.\\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\"See you over the summer, then.\"\\n\"Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking\\nuncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be sounpleasant.\\n\"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was\\nspreading over his face. \"They don\\'t know we\\'re not allowed to use magic\\nat home. I\\'m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer....\"\\nTHE END'"
